 Well, that parable didn't work. People interpreted it as about the dangers of external augmentation technology, which is not really what I had in mind. One person accused me of dystopianism, which is a sufficiently grave (and reasonable!) accusation to merit a response which I guess involves explaining the whole point outright.<p>If people have an explicit utility function, then they can be modeled as optimization processes trying to maximize that function.</p>
<p>There's only one best way to run an optimization process (bar the super unlikely case where by coincidence the function has multiple maxima of exactly the same height).</p>
<p>We don't choose our desires, at least not at the base level ("We can do what we want, but we can't want what we want"). So those are out of our control.</p>
<p>And we don't choose what, given a desire, is the best way to achieve it. That's determined by the way the world works. So the optimal plan to achieve our desires is also out of our control.</p>
<p>We necessarily choose our actions based on what best satisfies our desires. These may conflict, but in that case the strongest desire wins out. Even if we do something silly like hit our head with a hammer to prove we can do something we don't desire, that just proves that our desire to prove we can do something we don't desire is greater than our desire not to hit ourselves on the head.</p>
<p>So if our desires our out of our control, and given our desires our plans are out of our control, and given our plans are actions are out of our control, then nothing is in our control and our actions are entirely determined.</p>
<p>This is a stronger form of determinism than the usual boring "Yes, we're made out of matter which follows deterministic physical laws" type. Even if we call any calculations that go on within our brain "free will", the result of those calculations is still determined by our utility function and by the rules of strategy.</p>
<p>Even though the "made out of matter" determinism feels like free will, the "actions constrained by desire and strategy" determinism probably wouldn't. We can imagine a person whose utility*plan interactions are whispered to them by a magic earring, or a rationalist savant who performs mathematical calculations each instant to determine what to do, then goes with whatever branch of the decision tree returns the highest utility. Her actions are constrained entirely by the math and she does not subjectively experience free will.</p>
<p>We are saved from this fate by the fact that we're really really bad at perceiving our own utility function and at evaluating competing strategies. Our transhuman successors might not be so bad, and therefore would face this problem. I am unsure whether that would prevent them from being "people" in a vague philosophical sense. Even if people's minds turn out to be mathematical functions, there's a big difference in practice between a person and a mathematical function that just feels like it's a mathematical function.</p>
<p>The parable of the earring was not about the dangers of using technology that wasn't Truly Part Of You, which would indeed have been the kind of dystopianism I dislike. It was about the dangers of becoming too powerful yourself. Such power would probably be useful in an instrumental sense, and in a world like this one where there's a lot of work to be done it would probably be worth using. But in a non-failed world where happiness has become a major consideration, it might be an argument against becoming too formidable.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone in our world right now is in danger of this much formidability. But three hundred years from now when this is the biggest problem of the age, I'm going to say I called it.</p>

The ring makes you a p-zombie
That's really good, although rather scary!
I am not sure I would *care*!You're living an abnormally successful life, a rich and much-loved member of the community with a happy family?Who the heck cares *who* is living such a life? It's being lived, right? If you can do it with an earring and half of the brain, instead of all of the brain, so much the better!
Would you voluntarily ingest a parasitic worm that eats your brain, absorbs your goal system, hangs out in your skull, connects to your nervous system, and then lives about the same life you would live only better?(suppose for the moment that you're being selfish and ignoring concerns about whether the parasite would be better at pursuing efficient charity and so on)
In Greg Egan's "jewelhead" stories, everyone gets a jewel implanted in their head at the age of 18. The jewel gradually learns to predict the brain's responses to stimuli, without inspecting the internals of the brain. When the jewel's predictions become indistinguishable from perfect, the organic brain can be removed surgically, and the person lives happily ever after (the jewel grants immortality).
Yup, this story reminded me of those Greg Egan stories.

If I came to possess such a ring, I would commit (by any means at my disposal) to the following policy: I will wear the earring for a day or two every week and do as it says, with the proviso that if it ever tells me to do something for which I cannot see a plausible rationale, I will immediately take it off and not wear it again for another month.I wonder whether, in those circumstances, it would begin by telling me that I would be better to take it off. (If it did, I would.)
From: gjm112012-10-03 11:50 pm (UTC) (Link)
Such an *earring*, I mean. The idea of such a thing being a *ring* seems somehow terribly natural, Western culture being what it is.
One problem with the earring is similar to the problem with video game walkthroughs: it's more fun to figure things out for yourself. I can definitely imagine situations in which I'd want to *ask* the earring what to do, but I don't think I'd want it telling me everything, all the time. (Consider: I can play better chess by asking a computer chess program what move to make, but if I did that it would be boring, be cheating, or both.)
 If it would make you happiest to do a half-assed job at your work and then go home and spend the rest of the day in bed having vague sexual fantasies, the earring will tell you to do that. The earring is never wrong.Oh, this is very, very bad.Locking it up in a treasure vault isn't safe enough. I'd throw it into the nearest volcano.
From: gjm112012-10-04 02:58 pm (UTC) (Link)
The story stipulates that most people who wear the earring end up highly successful pillars of their local community, which suggests that it isn't in fact ("in fact"?! well, you know what I mean) generally leading people to spend all their time lying in bed having vague sexual fantasies.
My crucial question would be whether the ring discourages or facilitates growth. You specifically say it offers better, but not necessarily optimum, choices. If my decision making ability is capped under the earring, but would grow without it, then it's no wonder the earring told me to take it off.If I learn faster with the earring than without it, then it's a learning aid and I'd consider it, although I don't see how you can accept everything but the first command.
I would, by the way, say that was of publishable quality.I'd recommend sending it off to a few places, and see if any of them take it (Somewhere like http://dailysciencefiction.com/ if nothing else.)
The problem is that it's published so he can sell only second rights.
This post gave me hope. Every time I try to really write out my idea of the future I'm really scared of, I end up getting it wrong in some way. I was afraid for a moment that you'd done it with little effort in a random blog post, but then your earring ended up making people brainless which is obviously villainous and terrible and a clear reason to simply never put it on in the first place, and so the earring immediately became trivially avoidable and therefore non-scary. If you can't quite do it right, at least not yet, then maybe my inability is less because of my lack of creativity and more because it actually is a difficult idea.This will be getting it wrong, too, but I'm going to write only a couple of paragraphs so that the ways I'll get it wrong will at least be excusable by the lack of apparent effort. What if you could trust your hunch about people? What if, at least according to your perception, you could trust a person with well-fitting, clean, situation-appropriate clothes to make a good person to do business with while a huckster almost always looked like a huckster to you? What if there were pretty people in the world, but people who were available and who would make a good romantic partner to you just looked more glowingly beautiful than anyone else? What if people pitching to you ideas that would make bad career moves had annoying voices? What if, while fast food was decent, salad tasted really amazing?Say you could get Consequence Glasses that do just that. Say they even have a tuning knob. It goes from 0 to 1 because I am a geek. At 0 you get your natural perception with its natural biases, at 1 things probably will have to get a little bit abstract because so much becomes just a representation of what kind of consequences it leads to. Maybe it even works on some kind of a curve, so that if you just use them at, say, 0.1, it simply protects you from whatever tricks you're most vulnerable to - your most sinful foods taste just a bit stale but not in such a way that it makes you less happy, the well-designed rewards of videogames that keep you playing seem just a bit more arbitrary and distant, etc.. Only once you turn it higher does it really start directing you toward anything specific.You can decide to just not put the glasses on at all. You can decide to only run them at a very low level. Every turn of the knob is precisely your own choice. It's simply that the higher you turn it, the easier it will be to just do the right decisions in every situation. It won't even feel like someone else is in charge - it's you calling the shots, calling them as you see them. Hell, you were already wearing consequence glasses anyway, it's just that they're biased for inclusive fitness in mankind's ancestral environment, not for happiness and fulfillment in the modern world. Your existing emotional filters were never designed for the stimuli and for the consequences of this environment - changing your perception only makes them work better. It makes you into a more formidable person. A person with an easier life, yes, but only because your decisions are more grounded in reality, not less!Yes, you will become dependent on the glasses, just as you would on the earring. They're probably eventually even going to cause changes to your brain structure as you stop worrying so much about whether people are lying to you, about whether you're making the best possible use of your time, etc.. But it's a lot, lot harder to see them as taking anything away from you. Certainly you can't just brush it off with a generic "things should not be that convenient" type of argument.I do worry that the only way to figure out whether you should wear the glasses is to put them on and see how they look in a mirror...Edited at 2012-10-04 07:40 am (UTC)

I might use the glasses if they included some kind of penalty for using them maybe? 
Larry Niven's Protectors had a similar thing going, very high intelligence coupled with very strong instinctual drives meant they had precious little in the way of free will. You become a Protector by eating the tree of life: Your brain expands, your joints become enlarged (For extra leverage), skin becomes armor thick, gonads are reabsorbed and you become functionally immortal. And if you have no children to protect, you sit down and die.

If this is an allegory for something, consider whether you're not committing some of the dystopian fallacies that you yourself complained about earlier.And for mysterianism working better than clarity? Well, it's definitely easier to get away with a bad argument and get people to take it seriously if you write mysterious parable as opposed to a clear piece, so in that sense it "works" better.

You know, at first this seemed a bit scary...but then I had to ask: what if your goals are defined in terms of your cognition? IE, for example, I want be a famous and successful scientist, and I define "successful" as having unparalleled actual mastery of the art? Or if, in a more mundane example, I want to solve a Sudoku puzzle, and I define "having solved the puzzle" in a way that requires me to do the actual cognition, and derive the benefit of having solved the puzzle without being 'spoiled'? What sort of advice can the WE give? I'm sure it can give advice, and that the advice is useful...but if, as a result, I derive the benefit of the mental exercise that I wanted, I'm not entirely sure that this is a problem.There's a couple of ways read this. One is that the WE doesn't actually help you implement your 'real' goals, but the second or third order subgoals and that its first bit of advice, "take me off", was warning you about precisely this effect. Or you could read it as a warning about defining goals in such a way as to allow that being turned into a brainless puppet of an alien horror would accomplish those goal (if you think being turned into a brainless puppet would be bad). Another random thought - it seems that the second-stage WE has effectively replaced my lower-level functions with an extremely smart but alien intelligence that does everything better than I could do myself...the thing is, I'm not entirely convinced that this isn't already the case in reality. Certainly, if I tried to, say, catch a ball running on only my higher-level cognition that I consider "me", I'd fail utterly.
The earring sound oddly like yahoo answers. vague sexual fantasies indeed</div></div><hr><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" /></head>Page URL: http://squid314.livejournal.com/332740.htmlTitle: Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz - Mysterious maybe mythologically motivated Monogahela metropolitan motto</br>Author: Unknown</br><div><div>
One of the (few!) fun parts of applying for medical jobs is getting to see the weird little cities I could be living in next year. <p>Case in point: Morgantown, West Virginia. Home of 30,293 people and the West Virginia University medical system, which is looking for trainee psychiatrists. Also home to the country's only practical people-mover mass transit system. Not exactly New York City, but if they end up wanting me there are certainly worse places to have to spend the next four years.</p>
<p>But that's not what interests me. Wikipedia's pages on cities often list their town motto, which is always some boring collection of applause light words translated into Latin, like "Freedom, liberty, and also sovereignty"</p>
<p>Except the motto of Morgantown is "Vestigia nulla retrorsum regina monongahelae", or "The Queen of the Monongahela has nothing to return to." A few pages mention it, but none of them explain it or even acknowledge that it needs explanation.</p>
<p>Some quick research reveals a few leads. The Monongahela is a river that runs through the city. There's a city beauty pageant called "Queen of the Monongahela", although it seems just as likely that the pageant was named after some sort of historical or mythical figure as that the motto references a beauty queen.</p>
<p>But overall I'm stumped. It's not just the mysterious "Queen of the Monongahela". If the motto were "The Queen of the Monongahela smiles upon our beautiful city", that would fall into the category of "vague but complimentary" that marks a lot of town mottoes. But "has nothing to return to" sounds self-deprecatory, as if the city has become a sort of wasteland and if she ever came back (where is she, anyway?) she would find that everything she loved about it was gone.</p>
<p>In other words, it is a mystery that has been bothering me, and it is so far totally unprecedented in that the Internet has no answer.</p>
<p>Is anyone reading this blog from West Virginia or somewhere near West Virginia and possessing of an answer to this puzzle?</p>
<p>EDIT: mme_n_b is able to solve the problem both classily and classically.</p>

 Managed to stumble across a bioethics paper making almost the same argument I made about modafinil two posts ago: http://www.bioethicsjournal.com/past/pbj1.1_cahill.pdfIt does sometimes get bogged down in bioethicsy weasel words and concern-trolling, but in general it's an extremely impressive piece, considering. I also like the saying "pharmacological Calvinism", which I'd never heard before and which seems as good a phrase as any for the belief that medications that raise people "above normal" are bad because they might relieve the suffering of life.Overall I rate this abnormally excellent for a bioethics piece. She will be last against the wall when the revolution comes.I also clarified the last piece with the following, which I place here so it is more visible "60% serious may have been an overestimate (or we may have different scales of seriousness percent). I think the argument is correct in saying the benefits from modafinil would be much lower than most people think, but I was not fully serious in saying they would be zero, or less than the costs. I would, with some trepidation and a high expectation of regretting it later, endorse legalizing modafinil"</div></div><hr><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" /></head>Page URL: http://squid314.livejournal.com/332176.htmlTitle: Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz - Economic treadmill</br>Author: Unknown</br><div><div>

You're not accounting for population growth, GDP per capita. We have a larger population now. You also aren't accounting for the shifting ways we spend our GDP.I don't have data at my fingertips, but I do know that medical spending per person is closing in on 20% of GDP as we have the combined onslaught of an aging population combined with medical services that actually cure you. (In 1940 you didn't spend much on medicine because a.) you died of that first heart attack and b.) it didn't work very well.)I have clients calling me nearly every day complaining about spending $22K/year for a family medical insurance plan. They have the money, they would prefer to spend it on more discretionary things.And that leads to $100/barrel oil...Edited at 2012-10-01 09:30 pm (UTC)
Good point; I corrected the entry to be about GDP per capita. It's still very similar since population has increased much more slowly than GDP.Life expectancy not counting infant mortality has increased about four years since the 50s, and maybe one year since the 90s (it's actually going down in some populations).I acknowledge that is in fact part of the explanation, but I certainly don't think it detracts from the "How did we screw up so badly?" factor?
My memory of how GDP is constituted shows that financial services make a ton of money, and the income from that is very concentrated in the top .01% (1% of 1%) so that's another way to say income inequality is worse, but I don't think that's the whole story. I think Elizabeth Warren did a good job of teasing it out when she tried to explain shifting patterns of household consumption in one of her (more academic) books. We changed what we spend money on. We used to spend a lot more on food and clothing. Now we spend it on daycare/education and medical care and transportation and communication. I think it feels less discretionary, harder to skimp on. (You can wear hand-me-down dresses, but not use hand-me-down braces.)
Medicine does work some of the time, but at least in the US there seems to be a lot of thrashing around-- an expensive process of diagnosis and treatment before (as sometimes happens) something that works gets found.
This sounds like a "House" episode!I've studied this somewhat extensively - was on a panel implementing health care reform in Massachusetts under Romney - and *MOST* of the exploding spending on health care is simply increased utilitization.Whether the utilization is appropriate is another question, but theoretically someone somewhere thought it was, as opposed to just being an odd hobby for someone to have. Some might be due to defensive medicine in the face of malpractice threats, for example. Certainly some could be simply miscommunication.But for the most part, according to the studies I've seen, the consumers are consuming more. More knee replacements. More kidney replacements. More everything. When I look at our own anecdotal spending I can assure you that I value marginal increases in my own health FAR MORE than I value Other People's Money, i.e., I'm perfectly happy to have marginal increases of my health for very expensive procedures because I can get it done entirely for free (from my perspective.)
You're luckier than a fair number of people I know. Medicine that doesn't work isn't free even if it's paid for by other people's money. There's time, pain, and side effects to consider.
To what extent is the media's portrayal of how much things suck accurate? the "recession" barely touched me, for example, whereas iphones have definitely increased my standard of living. 
I think the economic problems are very unevenly distributed-- things for at least some of the people on my flist are very much worse than they used to be (at the needing to raise money for basic life support level-- there didn't used to be that sort of fund-raising), but one of my friends (relatively reclusive and works at Google) didn't know anyone who was in financial trouble.
Unemployment is really high, food stamps are really high, people are going years without finding a job.But if you have a job, it's a great time!
The Great Depression was a great time if you had a job. Low prices.Life is like that. It's an ill wind indeed that blows nobody any good.The question is how to tally up the goods and evils. Argument by anecdote has a notorious tendency to make things worse.
How exactly are you counting inflation? How are you counting the - for lack of a better term - evenness of the distribution of wealth?
I'm counting inflation by getting my numbers from a graph that measures real per capita income rather than nominal. I'm deliberately not counting evenness because if economic growth is useless because it all goes to the top who don't need it, that kind of proves my point.
"Is it a change in the way the money is distributed?"Duh. Haven't you seen all the stuff on stagnating median income?"If so, why isn't this something I can vote for in November?"That's not a question for economists.
Gas is more expensive than it was in 2000 (though not super high by historical standards, yet.)College is crazily expensive and getting more so, *and* increasingly necessary for a good job.Health care costs are shooting up (and worker compensation increases may be mostly absorbed by employer premiums.)Housing's complex, but definitely more expensive in lots of places where people would like to live.The 2000s recession recovery was slow and languid on the jobs front, just as currently the stock market is rising up (with record corporate profits) but unemployment is still really high.So it's more expensive to drive or send your kids to college or live in nice places, jobs are uncertain and pay stagnant, particularly below the professional level, 20-somethings with degrees often can't get jobs at all and are living at home.Meanwhile the top 1% is like 6x richer or something.But yay, you have a cell phone and infinite porn.
I'm personally much richer than I was in the 90s. That's mostly lifecycle effects (I was in my teens in the 90s and am 31 now), but I'm also significantly richer than either of my parents were in the 90s. YMMV.

It matters a great deal what components of GDP you're looking at. The computers and electronics that we're all so fond of are getting cheaper in price...which shows up as stagnant-or-falling sales. (There are attempts to correct for quality changes over time but it is, shall we say, not an exact science.)Other things go up in price but don't appear to improve in quality. There's some talk upthread about healthcare inflation - suffice it to say that I'd greatly prefer 1960s medicine to 1910s medicine but there's considerably less difference between 1960s and 2010s. Education is going up in price but certainly does not appear to be innovating fast (Coursera excluded - and free online ed doesn't show up in GDP!) Government services get counted in GDP and are growing fast but does not appear to be, say, suddenly solving poverty or anything. Land in cities is getting more expensive but that doesn't seem to benefit the nation as a whole (landlords are happy, renters aren't.)Tyler Cowen has been talking a lot about the Great Stagnation - an interesting concept even if you disagree, and his argument is that GDP growth since the '60s or so have basically been in areas healthcare, education, and government, in which simple the cost figures used in GDP are a bad proxy for quality. So we're not as rich as the numbers make us out to be.

It's also interesting to reflect that not all market transactions seem equally conducive to happiness. Suppose a jeans company manages to convince everyone in country A that they need to buy $100 jeans. Country A's GDP per capita will suddenly rise by $100 (and more if people work more to pay for them). Is country A really better off than country B which gets by on old Levi's? The answer is not obviously yes.Or, consider Universe A in which Coke and Pepsi are as they are now, vs. Universe B in which they hire lots of ad agencies and wage a zero-sum war over the (assumed inelastic) soft drink market. GDP goes through the roof; are they better off?Now clearly this reasoning can go overboard, with people saying crazy things like "Finance is nothing but a leech on the economy" or "Lawyers produce nothing of value" based on emotional reactions. Still, the weak version of "not all GDP is created equal" seems valid, and strikingly understudied.
Good point oh anonymous sage.Another example. This year is a really cold winter. People have to turn the heating up and consume more heating fuel. Last year was a really mild winter, so much so that people didn't need to turn their heating on at all. This year's GDP would be higher than last year's, but are people better off?
This doesn't necessarily follow; people who didn't spent money on gas bills may spend it elsewhere. There was concern early in 2012 that the 'recovery' might have been just activity shifting earlier in the year due to warmth.
Also true. I should have added a 'ceteris paribus' (the economist's favourite get-out clause).
There's also Bryan Caplan's side of the Great Stagnation argument to consider: the claim most of the big improvements to quality of life are undercounted in GDP statistics because they're made widely available at very low or zero price, so they're mainly consumer surplus.This is Caplan's latest post in the debate, with links to one or two previous posts.http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/10/how_stagnant_ar.html
Be careful about confusing wealth and income.While I have a lot of sympathy for the idea that actually people aren't poorer than they were, there are some factors I can think of that might be relevant here. These are from a British perspective, because that's where I am, but they're probably applicable in other western economies.1. People have to spend much more money during employment on their life after employment, that is savings and pensions. My grandfather started work when he was 15, retired when he was 65 and died when he was 68. He had 50 years to save up for three years of retirement. My father started work when he was 16, retired when he was 60 and is still alive and going strong at 67. I started full-time work when I was 22. If I retire at 65, I could maybe expect another 20 years of life, meaning that I have 43 years to save up for 20 years.2. Property prices are much, much higher than they were when my parents were buying a house (or even when my wife and I were buying our first house fifteen years ago). In the UK, this is largely because house building has not kept pace with population growth (from immigration among other factors) and because fewer people live in large families. Even new graduates with good jobs cannot expect to own their own house until they are several years into their careers.3. When I were a lad, they used to pay you to go to university. Now, you have to pay them.4. People look at their parents. While they don't tend to notice that their parents didn't have expensive holidays every year, or have all sorts of consumer electronics, or go out drinking every Saturday, they do notice that their parents owned their own house when they were in their twenties, had paid off the mortgage by the time they were fifty and retired early. And none of that seems likely for people who ate say 30 now.
It seems to be mostly unemployment. Productivity (and thus GDP per capita) will continue to skyrocket, while we have an ever growing class of zero marginal product workers who have no means of not being very low status.
On further consideration, I don't think one should be so quick to dismiss the value of expected future income. I've "spent" a lot of money to increase my expected future income, through education and long-term savings and investment, proving that on the margins I am willing to sacrifice current consumption for future earnings.I expect this is a major factor for people feeling poorer now than in the 90s despite per-capita income and wealth going up: expected rates of return on savings and investment are way down from the days of the Dot Com boom (between minuscule interest rates on bonds and bank accounts and the increased perceived risk and decreased expected average growth rate of stock and other equity investments), so the apparent price of future income has gone way up.
I think it's anticipation. You saw the same thing in the 50s- people had a lot less, comparatively, but the expectation was that things were getting better.
Lots of good comments in the thread so far (especially about rising health and education costs lacking corresponding improvements in health care and productivity), but here's an important point a student of cognitive bias should be able to appreciate: It may not be that growth is useless for improving society, it may just be that people are really, really, really bad at measuring societal improvement. See here. If you ask random people how much wealthier we are than typical Americans living in 1900, you are very likely to get answers along the lines of "twice as wealthy" and unlikely to get the correct answer of "nearly 10 times as wealthy." People overrate the past, and people are probably doing that for the 90s. Not that you're noticing a fake problem, but I'd bet it's overstated.The effect is probably exaggerated as you go back further. For the 50s we're talking about the childhood of baby boomers.

Transfer payments are over $2 trillion per year (http://united-states.reaproject.org/analysis/transfer-payments-ca35/) now; I'd be fascinated to hear what a massive redistribution program would look like by comparison.Some reasons increased GDP doesn't necessarily imply increased happiness:If most people are motivated by envy rather than greed (http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/why-envy-dominates-greed.html) then it doesn't matter what the absolute level of wealth is; the nth percentile is always going to be the nth percentile. This may even make some kind of evolutionary sense, if (proto)human development was culled less by death (where absolute status matters) and more by sexual selection (where relative status is all-important).Now that significantly fewer families have married parents (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/us/two-classes-in-america-divided-by-i-do.html?pagewanted=all), that increase in wealth doesn't go as far as it used to. Cooperating with your spouse to maintain a household for your family is far easier than separately maintaining two houses after shuffling around child support and/or alimony. This also creates rising household inequality (http://politicalcalculations.blogspot.com/2011/10/real-story-behind-rising-us-income.html) and feeds into that envy problem.Unemployment is high, but more importantly duration of unemployment is through the roof (http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/05/length-of-unemployment-continues-to-break-records/). There's a real fear now that if you start to fall behind it may easily become a permanent failure.There's also all the things that GDP doesn't measure in the same way you or I would measure it:If you have to take two jobs to make the same salary, your personal utility is probably in the toilet due to the lost free time, but your contribution to GDP is still the same.If you use a higher salary to buy things that you would otherwise make, then your personal consumption may be unchanged (or may be reduced by taxes, or may be lower quality in common cases like the stay-at-home-mom-&gt;daycare transition), but your and your trading partners' contribution to GDP goes up.If your skilled job is suddenly lost to or threatened by automation or outsourcing, GDP sees the current drop of "old_salary - new_salary", but from your point of view the change was "present_value(expected_integral_over_future(old_salary) - expected_integral_over_future(new_salary))", which may be an order of magnitude larger (or infinitely larger in the "threatened" case).

This married-parents statistics is has the highest stew yield of all oysters. Are we talking single parents, two-adult families where some or all of the children are stepchildren, couples that just don't think a marriage license matters? The latter two don't have more costs.
Well, yes, actually, they do. Cohabiting adults are much more likely to maintain separate supplies of stuff they both need.Not so much as a couple living separated but still more.
Massive redistribution&gt; bigger. Just because the current numbers are big doesn't mean bigger numbers don't exist. Of course there are problems with enforcing such a redistribution.
Falkenstein has a link to another study (http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/10/more-evidence-that-envy-trumps-greed.html) in which "envy dominates the results as the utility generally decreases when the peer group earns more and it increases when the peer group loses more than the subject."
Redistribution might be an answer, but perhaps somehow training people not to take joy in the suffering of others or suffering in their joy is also worth investigating.
Yes, it's distribution of wealth. We've got massively more income inequality than in 1990. The poor are about the same, the middle class is lower, and the rich are richer, and the super rich are SO AMAZINGLY STRATOSPHERICALLY RICHER that normal economic models start breaking around them.The GDP per capita growth happens because of the 0.1%.
As others have said, increasing the mean without increasing the median is, in fact, useless from an improving-society point of view.
The other half of it is economic security versus insecurity. When the labor market is as slack as it is currently, the consequences of losing a job are catastrophic. Security is a commodity, and it is currently very expensive. A person in the 1950s lived not nearly as well as we do today, but he had the confident expectation that by continuing to do his job well, he would remain skilled and relevant, he could continue to provide for his family, his children would grow up in a society where they had an equal opportunity to everyone else, his job and society and his own prudence would combine to provide him with a pension, Social Security, and personal savings that would lead to a comfortable retirement.All or most of that is frayed, and most of the reason for the fraying is the concentration of wealth into a small number of hands.
&gt; most of the reason for the fraying is the concentration of wealth into a small number of hands.Why is this the case, rather than both being the result of other trends?
Fair enough. Both the concentration of wealth and the dismantling of the social services that supported the middle class and shielded it from misfortune are the predictable result of the same deliberate choices and actions made by a set of political entities. They're connected but they have a common source.

 Very many of my friends sing the praises of modafinil (I have not tried it myself). They say it can make you more focused, more productive, and at least temporarily remove the basic human need for sleep. It doesn't have the normal stimulant side effects of "buzz" and agitation. And it's cheap and has fewer side effects than aspirin (EDIT: it does interact with other drugs including birth control and should be used with caution if you're on anything else; thank you celandine13).<p>(it's really convenient that aspirin became a poster child for "safe, commonly used medication" despite having such an crazy array of potential deadly side effects. It means that whenever you want to push a new drug, you can say it has "fewer side effects than aspirin" and be pretty sure that you're right)</p>
<p>Despite its excellent safety profile, it is currently a Schedule IV controlled substance in the United States.</p>
<p>Doesn't this mean that I must be wrong about its excellent safety profile? No. See for example Gwern's research on the subject. About half the people reading this paragraph are going to say "Wait, don't the FDA and the entire decision-making apparatus of the United States government have more data and credibility than one guy with a website?" The other half of the people know Gwern.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that adrafinil, a prodrug of modafinil which is strictly more dangerous because it contains all the side effects of the latter plus a risk of liver damage, is totally legal without any prescription at all. And modafinil is freely available over the counter in various countries (I think Spain and India) and they have yet to collapse into unspeakable wastelands of despair.</p>
<p>(actually, Spain kinda did, but it seems unrelated.)</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that the alternative to modafinil is using legal stimulants, like Red Bull and Four Loco. These actually are dangerous and can, for example, cause abnormal heart rhythms that kill you. We also saw a steady trickle of energy drink overusers in the psychiatric hospital, and although you probably need to have an inborn disposition for energy drinks to tip you over the edge, who knows how common such an inborn disposition really is? Modafinil is probably way safer than these totally unrestricted alternatives.</p>
<p>So you would think that I am going to argue that modafinil should be legalized. Or at least that the cultural stigma against using it should be relaxed. But that would be too easy. Actually, I want to argue the opposite.</p>
<p>Let's assume that the wildest claims of my friends are correct. Some of these friends got through medical school with relatively little damage by using modafinil to study eight or ten hours a day and skip sleep. Others are in the rationality community and use it to concentrate on their programming or mathematics work. They mostly agree with Gwern that it can be modeled as adding four hours to the day, both in the form of costlessly lost sleep and in the form of greater attention during waking hours.</p>
<p>Economists distinguish between positional goods and...and I can't find what the opposite of a positional good is, so let's call it an absolute good. A positional good is something where it doesn't matter exactly how much of the good you have, but only what your ranking is relative to everyone else. Superyachts are probably a positional good. I don't think anyone thinks "Man, this 100 foot yacht is crap, there isn't nearly enough room for all my yachting-related activities." They think "My neighbor has a 200 foot yacht; my 100 foot yacht looks crappy in comparison. I should build a 300 foot yacht." If the person involved had the option of destroying her neighbor's 200 foot yachts, then her 100 foot yacht would suddenly become more than enough.</p>
<p>An absolute good is the opposite. For example, if you're injured, you want painkillers as an absolute good. It doesn't matter whether your neighbors are getting more or less painkillers than you are, so much as that you are getting enough painkillers to take away your pain.</p>
<p>Except it's actually really hard to think of pure absolute goods. A lot of things I was going to put as my absolute good example don't really work, because our idea of what's acceptable is set by our friends and neighbors. In Haiti, people who had a house made of real sheet metal felt awesome, because most of their neighbors were still living in refugee tents; meanwhile in America a house made of sheet metal would be awful because everyone needs to have a McMansion; a McMansion, however, is quite sufficient. But in the postsingularity thoughtspace of 19-uvara-46-asxura, everyone has their own continent perfectly terraformed as a projection of ver innermost dreams, and someone with a McMansion feels as left-out and squalid as someone living in a sheet-metal shack in America. </p>
<p>The richer you are, the more your goods shift from absolute to positional; 90% of the value of a $5000 used car is its getting-you-places-ness, but 90% of the value of a $500000 Ferrari is its looking-cool-relative-to-other-cars.</p>
<p>Right now America and to a lesser degree other first-world countries are caught in a trap where almost all of their economic growth is funneled to the rich and upper-middle-class, who spend it on positional goods. Since all the rich people are spending it on positional goods equally, none of their relative position changes in any interesting way and all of the positional goods are useless. </p>
<p>Therefore in the modern era most economic growth in first-world countries is pretty useless as a direct action. There may be useful indirect actions, like advancing technology, increasing tax revenue that can be spent on useful absolute goods, and increasing the amount that flows as charity to the Third World, but the actual direct effect of economic growth is pretty close to zero.</p>
<p>Okay, let's go back to modafinil. Right now the FDA is pretty incompetent and doesn't enforce any of its own restrictions, so in practice anyone can get modafinil. And getting modafinil is currently very useful. If you're in medical school, and you're not doing very well, you can take some modafinil, gain a big unfair advantage over your peers, and shoot up the class rankings. If you're an executive, you can work much harder and get a promotion your friends can't. If you're a programmer, you can amaze the world with your vastly improve programming output.</p>
<p>But let's say the FDA restrictions on modafinil switched from "poorly enforced" to "nonexistent", and let's say that at the same time the cultural stigma against using mind-enhancing drugs went away. Now what?</p>
<p>Now instead of hiding their use behind vague rumors, those medical students trumpet their brilliant discovery of this new wonder drug to everyone. All medical students start taking modafinil, except maybe some with religious restrictions or something. Of course, this doesn't mean that all medical students get As all the time. It means that the medical schools make their coursework much harder, and the medical students go back to being on the cusp of failure. Except now that it's harder, it's impossible for most students to pass medical school without modafinil. So the religious people flunk out, everyone else has to work much harder, and in the end no student gains. Arguably future patients might gain from having better trained doctors, but I think this wildly overestimates the usefulness of the medical education system.</p>
<p>The same is true of executives. Now modafinil no longer means an easy promotion. Now all the executives start taking modafinil, and everyone has the same chance of getting promoted as before, except the religious people and the people who are allergic to modafinil and anyone who has a personal preference for getting more than three hours of sleep per night even though it's not strictly necessary.</p>
<p>Basically, obligations are a demon that eats up all the free time and happy things in your life. If only a few people have modafinil, they have an extra weapon against the demon. If everyone has modafinil, expectations and competition increase and so the demon becomes stronger. A new equilibrium is established in which there's more economic growth (so the rich get some more useless positional goods) but everyone gets four hours less sleep per night, plus they have to spend money on modafinil, plus the few people who can't take modafinil for one reason or another are screwed.</p>
<p>"But wait," you say. "Couldn't people just decide to work shorter hours and instead use the extra time they have in the day to see their family or pursue their hobbies or volunteer or do something good?"</p>
<p>Yes, we don't live in a totalitarian society, so that choice technically exists. Just as the choice technically exists for people to try that now. Most people earn much more than they need to live. So in theory, they have the option of working twenty-five hour weeks and spending the extra fifteen hours hiking or gardening.</p>
<p>But in practice, people don't. The majority of well-paying acceptable jobs demand a forty-hour work week, and most people don't have the freedom to look for the ones that don't. It costs companies less money in training and overhead to hire two people to work 40-hour weeks than four people to work 20-hour weeks, and so they will always prefer the 40-hour workers. If you want to be a prestigious doctor or lawyer or executive or whatever you have to signal your commitment by working even longer than the 40-hour Schelling point. In practice, you're working as long as the companies are legally and socially permitted to make you, which in our society is 40 hours.</p>
<p>If suddenly days magically get four more hours in them, then the work week will shoot up to 60 hours and stay there. People might get paid more, but the economy will adjust so that the extra money becomes necessary just to tread water, the same way it looked like people were getting paid more when women entered the work force and the family could theoretically double its income but everything adjusted. The extra economic growth will go to positional goods for the rich, and you will get 20 hours less sleep per week (granted without a corresponding decrease in restfulness), have to pay for modafinil out of your own pocket, but otherwise be in about the same position. </p>
<p>(couldn't the government just make a law fixing the work week at its current length thus preventing this race to the bottom and all of its unfortunate consequences? In an ideal world, yes, but the small-L libertarians would never allow it.)</p>
<p>So legalizing modafinil (with corresponding reduction of stigma) leads directly to you having to work four hours more every day, gain an extra item on your budget (modafinil: $1000-$3000/year), get four hours less sleep (admittedly without restfulness cost, but still unpleasant especially for a lucid dreaming hobbyist like myself), plus suffer any unknown side effects of the drug that might turn up. And for all this, you get the chance to earn money that the economy immediately siphons off and throws away on more positional goods.</p>
<p>Despite this I'm still not sure it would be so bad. Economic growth is a pretty powerful force, and even if most of the force is wasted there are still those small direct effects on the poor/middle class plus the indirect effects which might end up being much more powerful. And maybe the government will stand up to the libertarians and fix the work-week, or the creeping increase wouldn't be as inevitable as I think.</p>
<p>But compare these possible benefits of legalization to how downright optimal the current modafinil regime is.</p>
<p>From what two of my friends in the modafinil business have told me, it's really easy to get modafinil now - just order it online with PayPal and wait a little while for shipping. And no one ever really gets in trouble for it; Gwern's research turns up only a single case in the entire history of the US in which someone got busted for modafinil, and he speculates it was just a racist Southern court looking for some excuse to convict a poor suspicious-looking black person. This probably does not generalize to risk for the average user.</p>
<p>So in practice, the current regime offers no downsides to seeking modafinil. It is much more of a psychological barrier than an actual barrier. But it is an effective psychological barrier, which only a few people get across. Who?</p>
<p>First of all, they have to be individuals rather than institutions. A big Fortune 500 company requiring all of its employees to take modafinil probably would get busted by the FDA.</p>
<p>Second, they can't care too much about social stigma. There's still a stigma on stimulant use, probably carried over from some of the other stimulants which really are pretty scary (WAItW, anyone?). And of course there's a stigma on breaking the law.</p>
<p>Third, they have to be intelligent. Anyone without at least a little curiosity is going to do what everyone else is doing and take Red Bull or Four Loco. They're never going to find good analyses like Gwern's research, and they probably couldn't understand them even if they did. An unintelligent person won't be able to distinguish modafinil from the thousand different quack remedies that are supposed to make you "more awake!" and "give you the extra energy you need to complete your day!"</p>
<p>Fourth, they have to be kind of..not really anti-establishment, but at least less violently pro-establishment than usual. It's pretty hard for most people to say "Well, I guess the government is wrong about this, might as well circumvent them." But that's pretty much all the counter-culture ever does.</p>
<p>So: individual intelligent non-social anti-establishment people. Basically geeks. And a very specific kind of geek, too. I won't specify exactly which kind beyond that link, because internecine geek feuds always turn ugly, but I think it is pointing to a particular geek cluster.</p>
<p>It's hard not to be suspicious that God has planned this all along. He's basically saying "Behold, geeks, you are My chosen people, so I give unto you a major advantage over non-geeks. The hilarious part shall be that it is self-selecting; anyone who chooses to use this is the sort of person I trust to have an advantage in society. Anyone who chooses not to use it, well, they probably would just screw it up anyway."</p>
<p>And because these geeks remain a very small percent of the population, the problems with large-scale use don't occur. The angel Technology giveth with the right hand, but the demon Economics doesn't notice and so doesn't wake up to taketh away with the left hand. It's not that it's a win-win situation. It's that it's a win-neutral situation, which in terms of positional goods is even better.</p>
<p>So what does it say about me that I don't (haven't yet?) used modafinil? I'm not sure. I've always known I'm not a very good anti-establishment specific-cluster geek. Last night when a friend was explaining his theory of PCs (people who are actively doing interesting work and changing the world in such a way that things revolve around them) and NPCs (people who mostly just hang around and provide background), I might have been the only person at the table not especially convinced he was a PC.</p>
<p>Not that I feel any deep sense of inadequacy about this. NPCs can be pretty neat too. Schala was an NPC. If I can be as awesome as she was, I'll be pretty happy.</p>
<p>Oh, right. Nothing in this post should be taken as any kind of official medical endorsement of modafinil, which I have not studied in a medical context and which I am not anywhere near officially qualified to recommend or disrecommend. Nothing else in this post was more than about 60% serious, but this paragraph is entirely serious.</p>
<p>[EDIT: 60% serious may have been an overestimate (or we may have different scales of seriousness percent). I think the argument is correct in saying the benefits from modafinil would be much lower than most people think, but I was not entirely serious in saying they would be zero, or less than the costs. I would, with some trepidation and a high expectation of regretting it later, endorse legalizing modafinil]</p>

Little-known sexual orientations
[Sep. 29th, 2012|05:09 pm]
(see also: Little-known forms of government)Metaheterosexuality: Attracted only to heterosexual people, regardless of their sex.Metahomosexuality: Attracted only to homosexual people, regardless of their sex.Synosexuality: Attracted only to people who are attracted to you.Asynosexuality: Attracted only to people who are not attracted to you.Henosexuality: Attracted only to one person.Xenosexuality: Attracted to people inversely proportionally to how well you know them.Godelosexuality: Attracted only to people to whom you cannot prove you are attracted.Thalassosexuality: Married to the sea.Kakosexuality: Attracted only to the worst possible person.Constitutional bisexuality: Attracted to both men and women, but all partners must be approved by the legislature.</div>

No surprise, we metabisexuals have been overlooked again.
First of all I didn't want to harp on that one theme for too many entries. But second of all, what exactly would metabisexuality mean? It *could* mean you're only attracted to bisexuals...but then it could also mean you're attracted to both homosexuals and heterosexuals (of either sex), which in practice would make metabisexuality equivalent to regular bisexuality and therefore redundant.Maybe we need to distinguish between metabisexuality and bimetasexuality?
From: (Anonymous)2012-09-30 05:08 am (UTC) (Link)
&gt;Maybe we need to distinguish between metabisexuality and bimetasexuality?So metabisexuality is when you only like bisexuals, and bimetasexuality is when you like heterosexuals and homosexuals but not bisexuals?
In actuality, I am primarily attracted to people who can share my appreciation of both (all) sexes mostly this means bisexuals, but also women who are attracted to themselves, or who enjoy heterosexual porn (which usually highlights the women more than the men.)I find straight and gay people too closed-minded in their appreciation of human beauty, so, yes, I am meta-bisexual.
It *could* mean you're only attracted to bisexualsThis sort of exists, in the sense of "people who want to have hetersexual threesomes". It may even be quite common :)

Well, Scott is listing "little-known sexual orientations", and metabiheterosexuality is the commonest male sexual orientation in the US...
Well, Scott is listing "little-known sexual orientations"I really don't think he is.
Metasynosexuality is nice work if you can get it.
(here via andrewducker)According to this list I've been an asynosexual and kakosexual more often than not. Oh well.
I had no idea I was Godelosexual!
At last! My classical studies have a use!
You are only attracted to cold thieving birds that are on fire? Or to people who steal cold birds that are on fire? Or to people on fire who steal cold birds? Or to birds on fire who steal cold people? Or to all of the above?
Stealing frozen chickens, dousing them in vodka and igniting them - it's the new 50 Shades...
...a cold stolen bird in the hand is worth two in the burning bush, what? *blinking*
Russexual: attracted only to people who shave themselves :)
Figarosexual: attracted only to people who shave every man who does not shave himself.
Tautosexuality: Attracted only to people who you're attracted to.</div>

You're Pope *now*. Everyone is. Carry on.
Was Achilles real? Was Odysseus?The Iliad and Odyssey and Aeneid are full of flawed, powerfully drawn characters that seem almost real. They resonate. And who would *make up* a guy with a bed made out of a tree? Somebody *must* have done that, right?Ancient writers and storytellers were not stupid. They were as capable of fictional depth as we are (maybe more so.) They didn't all write boring, one-note propaganda tracts. It's just a sign of our temporal provincialism that we expect the Bible to be a propaganda tract and are surprised that there are human, breathing, flawed characters in it. Siegfried and Signy seemed "real" too. Myth has a way of ringing true.Then again, there's historical evidence of an actual Jesus; AFAIK he really was a preacher who was crucified. If my beloved friend and teacher were tortured to death by the government, you can bet I'd be telling people about him and trying to live up to his message. I'm sure the grief was real.
I suspect that Achilles and Odysseus, and indeed most of the characters in the Iliad and Odyssey, were based on real personages. During a Dark Age, oral epics are the best available source of any history before the lives of grandfathers-of-grandfathers.The Aenid, however, is deliberate historical fiction, or epic fanfic. It was written as a conscious act of fiction by a man (Virgil) who lived in a time when the rich and educated had access to copious records, and hence the epic oral tradition of the Classical Dark Age had long-since perished. However ...... it may well have been well-researched fiction, in that Virgil may have had access to sources now long since lost, including Etruscan ones. While the Romans lost all their official written records in the Gallic attack of 390 BC, there may have been unofficial written records not lost, and official written records which survived in other cities. And while the Rome of the earliest kings was almost certainly illiterate, and even more so the Latium of earlier times, oral traditions may have survived long enough to have been written down.I would provisionally accept the reality of Numa, Romulus etc. and the possible reality of Aeneas. There actually is some archaeological evidence that some of the ancestors of the Etruscans and allied peoples came from Asia Minor, and since we know that Troy was real ...... though, sadly, the story of Aeneas and Dido has to be either false or a conflation with some other true event, because the chronology doesn't match. Trojan War was late 12th or early 11th century BC; Carthage was founded in the 9th century BC, and Rome in the 8th century BC. A survivor of the fall of Troy could not possibly have encountered an extant city of Carthage: if he did meet people in a city in North Africa, they could not have been Carthaginians even if they lived in the same area, just as Moses or Joshua could never have met a Roman and for the same reasons.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_of_embarrassment for those interested in the topic.Also, as far as Islam goes - the satanic verses are an embarrassing story, and as child marriage has gone out of fashion, that became another embarrassing story.
I was trying to remember that criterion name!
The child marriage is almost certainly a true story, too -- it was not particularly exceptional in most pre-industrial cultures. For that matter, our whole concept of setting the statutory age of consent at late (rather than early) adolescence is historically very recent: the relevant laws are rarely more than 100-200 years old; and in most pre-industrial cultures there is no formal "age of consent" -- it's just assumed that men aren't much interested in sex with pre-adolescent children. Which is as a general rule quite true, though there are of course exceptions.
Oh, by the way: onset of menstruation is usually timed by intake of protein. In pre-industrial societies, aristocratic girls, who had high-protein diets, often started menstruating around the same time that girls do today (10-14); peasant children, who had low-protein diets, might not start menstruating until later (14-18). Aisha bint Abu Bakrhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aishawould definitely have enjoyed a high-protein diet, and it's quite plausible that Muhammed chose to consumnate the marriage after her first menses (which signifies "womanhood" in many pre-industrial societies). According to the Quran she was 6 or 7 at the time of the marriage and 9 or 10 at the time the marriage was actually consumnated.It is unreasonable to expect Muhammed to have looked ahead to American or British laws on age-of-consent and managed his marital life on this basis. There is also no particular reason to assume that Aisha was particularly offended by her treatment, as it was normal for her society, she had been incredibly lucky in the identity of her husband, she showed numerous signs later on of extreme loyalty to him, and one of the good things about Muhammed was his treatment of women (the really extreme misogyny entered Islam after Muhammed's death). She wasn't looking ahead to our laws on age-of-consent either, and hence would not have felt "abused" unless he actually abused her, and there's no evidence that he did.And yes, I believe that Muhammed and the other figures from his life were all real until proven otherwise. Though not the angels and stuff: these were Muhammed's delusions.

&gt; She wasn't looking ahead to our laws on age-of-consent either, and hence would not have felt "abused" unless he actually abused her, and there's no evidence that he did.That doesn't sound right. In general, it's possible for people to be hurt by normal things: of course if you're a man and your people lose a war you get killed, that's how war works and war is glorious and necessary. You're still dead.And if it is correct in that case, then our age of consent laws are stupid. Raped kids are horribly traumatized, we spend a lot on catching and imprisoning child molesters, who get beat up and raped by other inmates, and pedophiles have to wrestle with sexual frustration all their lives. If we can get rid of all of these by teaching a few generations that sex with tweens is normal, why aren't we doing that?
Our age-of-consent laws are stupid. We treat sexual relations with adolescent minors as being exactly the same thing as sexual relations with pre-adolescent minor children, and that as exactly the same thing as having sex with babies; we pay little attention under the law to the minor's consent or lack of consent; and in consequence we often not only punish some perpetrators too severely and other too leniently (since we must apply the same law to lover, seducer and rapist alike). What's worse, we often apply the law in ways which hurts the victim (who in some cases is only a nominal "victim") far worse than the perpetrator (who may or may not have actually done something bad. Even worse than that, our incredibly corrupt and inept child protection system may wind up handing said victim over to people who actually will beat and rape her (or him, sometimes) and may also wind up handing her siblings over to such abusers in foster families.We imagine that the statutory-rape ahd child molestation laws were set up to protect children. They were not. They were actually set up, during the 19th century, to allow the parents of adolescent girls to have boyfriends of whom the parents disapproved threatened with, or actually subjected to, imprisonment to increase the degree of parental control over said adolescents. Originally, nobody but the parents would have reported the "statutory rapist" or "molester" in the case, and in cases where good feelings existed between parents and boyfriend, these "crimes" of course went unreported.Then, when the government became more intrusive in the lives of individuals (late 19th to early 20th century), the government began seeking out anyone who violated these laws. In most cases the level of injustice was still fairly low, because early age-of-consent laws usually set the age of consent around 14-16 years old.Then, starting in the late 1940's, when the mood moved toward overprotection of teenagers in response to the problem of "juvenile delinquency" and increasingly open teenage sexuality), municipalities and states everywhere began moving the age of consent up to 18 -- almost in lockstep with a reduction of the average age at which girls were actually losing their virginity.Today we have a system so insane that almost everywhere in the United States the age of consent is 18, despite the fact that girls are actually losing their virginity on the average at around 14-16. What's more, human nature being what it is and girls being attracted mostly to older men (by which I mean late teens / early twenties), this means that there is massive violation of age-of-consent laws in fact: depending on the particular State's law, there may or may not be an exception for boys who are only slightly older than the girls (yes, there are areas where it is technically illegal for an 18 year old to have sex with a 17 year old!).Consider what happens to a girl who falls in love with an older boy, marries him and is financially dependent on him before she is "rescued" by the State authorities. She is "helped" by the State by her husband being put in prison on a felony charge which -- if he survives -- will make it difficult to impossible for him to get a legitimate job. What's even worse, the girl doesn't have to be a minor at the time of the arrest -- there have been cases where such arrests were made after the girl had attained the age of majority.There was one case I remember where anti-child-pornography statutes destroyed the lives of a couple even though both were minors at the time the "pornography" was made. A 17-year-old girl had her picture taken naked by her (also 17-year-old) finacee, as a romantic gesture. They turned 18, were married, and made the mistake of letting the existence of the photo be known. The husband was convicted on charges of producing child pornography, and wound up with a felony record, destroying his career and their future. Who the HELL was the State protecting here?
"almost everywhere in the United States the age of consent is 18"If by "almost everywhere" you mean "in 12 states".http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_North_America#State_lawsGranted it has two of the biggest states, while the nine age 17 states have Texas, Illinois, and New York; I lack the interest to add up population figures and see how many people live under the three regimes.AIUI exemptions for being close in age are common, as is a blanket exemption for being married. Of course, you need parental permission to marry underage. California is unusually strict and punitive.
You're right: I didn't research that, I just assumed, having spent most of my life in "age-of-consent = 18" states. These states however include New York and California, which are among the most important centers of the American media, which only reinforces the American assumption that there is something special about age 18 and that sex with anyone younger than 18 is morally "pedophiliac." (Which is incidentally a misuse of the psychological term, as "pedophilia" refers to sexual attraction to prepubescents rather than adolescents).
"These states however include New York and California"No, the age of consent in New York is *17*. Still high, but not 18. It's right there in the comment you're replying to!I'm baffled that you've had a long-time interest in this topic without ever looking up what the laws actually were.
In any case, while Muhammed was a rotten bastard and a scourge to the human race in general, there is absoulutely no reason to believe that Aisha was hurt by her marriage to him, or by her early sexual relations with him. Ths situation was absolutely normal in her culture, and he seems to have treated her well. In this case, I am willing to defend Muhammed -- not against the charge of marrying and (a few years later) consumnating his marriage with his child bride, but against the claim that by doing so he "abused" her.
If we can get rid of all of these by teaching a few generations that sex with tweens is normal, why aren't we doing that?I didn't say that "sex with tweens is normal." What I do say is that, biologically, both boys and girls are primed to seek out sexual contact with members of the opposite sex as soon as they hit puberty. What's more, there is a very strong tendency for girls to seek out higher-status males for such contact (because they have to be more careful about the possible biological and social consequences of sex), which means that by and large girls are attracted to older boys.We can make any rules or laws that we want, and we have to limit human sexuality in certain ways to avoid all sorts of social problems, but if we actively deny reality where human biology is concerned, we are risking all sorts of other social problems: not the least of which are the consequences of criminalizing behavior which is often common, consenusal, and non-harmful to the participants. I could show you long lists of people whose lives were ruined because they fell afoul of the age-of-consent laws: this list would not be limited to the "perpetrators," but would also include many of the supposed "victims," who found the State destroying them as well.When it comes to another culture which operated under very different technological limitations than do we, it is especially absurd for us to try to impose the American age-of-consent of 18 years old (!!!) and then assume that anyone who failed to obey this future foreign mandate. It is historically normal for the daughters of pre-industrial aristocrats or rich merchants (who start menstruating around 10-14) to marry around 12-16 and consumnate their marriages by 14-16. By our standards, almost all males from such families were "pedophiles" -- which shows the absurdity of these standards.
I believe people also use this same idea to argue that the enslavement of the Jews in Egypt must be historical.
It might very well be true: there is archaeological evidence for the presence of a Hebrew minority in Egypt during and after the presumed time of Joseph. What's more, they would have come in under the Hyksos, and hence might have for obvious reasons been resented by the resurgent Egyptian nation come the New Kingdom -- the part of the history that the Bible studiously ignores.
Really? The consensus from people who were specifically sent out to prove it was "never happened".
Richard Carrier conclusively demolishes the ridiculous Criterion of Embarrassment in Proving History (which I think everyone should read). Durant definitely nodded when he came up with that one.</div></div><hr><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" /></head>Page URL: http://squid314.livejournal.com/331223.htmlTitle: Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz - Kol Nidre</br>Author: Unknown</br><div><div>
"You've been pretty unproductive lately.""Yeah, I know. I usually use precommitments to handle my productivity, but I've been stymied by the proximity of Kol Nidre, the Jewish/game theorist holiday that voids all precommitments.""The ... it ... what?"Kol Nidre is pretty neat, even though the old-timey Christians used it as an excuse for anti-Semitism a lot. Its Hebrew name literally means "all vows", and it is the night on which Jews recite a chant forsaking all the vows they have made in the past year the coming year it's complicated:"All [personal] vows we are likely to make, all [personal] oaths and pledges we are likely to take between this Yom Kippur and the next Yom Kippur, we publicly renounce. Let them all be relinquished and abandoned, null and void, neither firm nor established. Let our [personal] vows, pledges and oaths be considered neither vows nor pledges nor oaths."The medieval Christians found this amazingly sketchy for perfectly understandable reasons. It sounds like any religious group that has a holiday in which they specifically release themselves from all their promises is a religious group that cannot be fully trusted.But things are not as bad as all that. Rabbinic tradition says that the declaration covers only a certain class of vows: exactly which class is a complicated question, but my interpretation of it is that it is those whose breaking would be a "victimless crime", one which does not affect any second party. So if you loan money to a Jew and she promises to pay it back, you're safe.What is the point of this? There are two good historical explanations, one of which is interesting and one of which is true. The interesting one is that sometimes anti-Semites would haul the Jews before the Inquisition and make them swear to become good Christians and stop practicing Judaism. The Jews naturally didn't want to be held to an oath they made at gunpoint, but they felt really bad about breaking it. So they invented the Kol Nidre as an official release from those kinds of oaths.It's not quite true, because the Kol Nidre is at least fifteen hundred years old, antedating the Inquisition by a good bit. And it's not even entirely clear to me whether breaking oaths to the Inquisition is covered by it; as linguistically uncomfortable as it is to call the Inquisition "a victim", forswearing them doesn't seem to be an entirely victimless crime.The true historical explanation is that the Jews tended to go overboard with religious vows a lot. It was the Iron Age equivalent of "God, if I pass this final exam I will totally go to synagogue every day from now on" or even of a New Years' Resolution: "I swear to God that this year I will learn the whole Torah, seriously, no excuses." They were made in the heat of the moment, they weren't very smart, and people ended out feeling guilty about it, because vows are really important in Judaism and Jews are very good at feeling guilty. And since people feeling guilty all the time was a bad thing, they implemented Kol Nidre. It used to absolve people of their broken vows in the past year. Then it was decided it would be a little more credible if it absolved them in the coming year, since it would prevent people from having to spend a year feeling guilty and it would kind of be adding a disclaimer to your upcoming vows that made breaking them less of a sin. At the same time, it acknowledges our sinfulness and asks God's forgiveness.I like Kol Nidre from a game theoretic perspective. I frequently make precommitments, like "I will study flashcards at least ten minutes a day from now on." These are useful; they prevent me from becoming super lazy all the time. And I am pretty good at keeping them, if I do say so myself, because I basically think if I ever break them I will never be able to trust myself again.On the other hand, sometimes those precommitments get old. Maybe after studying flashcards at least ten minutes a day for eight months, I've learned everything flashcardable I want to know, and I have better things to do with my ten minutes. Maybe I realize that flashcards aren't really that good a study method after all and want to switch to one I think is better. Maybe I didn't realize exactly how annoying those flashcards would be.For exactly that reason, I usually set a time limit to all my precommitments. But time limits are hard to keep track of, and sometimes my time limits are too long. So I celebrate Kol Nidre as a sort of built-in precommitment expiration date that prevents me from ever making a precommitment of more than a year. When it comes around, I auto-cancel all my precommitments and start over.And of course sometimes that means making exactly the same precommitment for another year, because I'm not totally dumb and a lot of the time whatever got me into the original precommitment is still totally valid. But sometimes it doesn't, and I'm super thankful for the ability to get out of the stupid deal I talked myself into on one day of the year, without setting a general policy of absolving myself from anything at any time.Aside from the two historical explanations above, there's a kabbalistic explanation for Kol Nidre as well. As soon as you hear "kabbalistic" you think "this is going to be super weird and super awesome", and the kabbalists do not disappoint. They say that all year, God is watching all the horrible things we do and thinking "Oh man, I am totally going to do some righteous smiting on that squid314 person." And as God finalizes destinies for the New Year (which for Judaism and therefore for God begins in late September/early October) He is remembering all those resolutions He made. Kol Nidre is when we release ourselves from our vows in the hope that God will reciprocate by releasing Himself from His and so let us live and stay happy and healthy for another year.Hope it works.</div></div><hr><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" /></head>Page URL: http://squid314.livejournal.com/330825.htmlTitle: Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz - Luke Muehlhauser Facts</br>Author: Unknown</br><div><div>

One common apologetics tactic is the argument from the historicity of Christ and the Apostles. That is, the Apostles said they saw the Resurrection of Christ, and it would take quite a conspiracy to make twelve different people lie - not to mention to make them stick to the lie even after Christianity became unpopular and it became clear they would be persecuted or even die for their faith. If the Apostles had been making the story of the Resurrection up, there were ample opportunities for them to say so. Yet either they never did, or it never made it into the tradition.A common atheist argument is to deny the authenticity of the tradition entirely. That is, not only is the legend of the Resurrection made up, but the legend that the Apostles testified to the Resurrection is made up, and if there are any stories of people testifying they heard the Apostles testify to the Resurrection, those stories are made up too. I find this argument sort of okay but disappointingly lacking in curiosity. There cannot be an infinite regress; after all the made-up legends there has to be a real person or conspiracy of real people making them up. And the idea of a huge Early Church conspiracy to make up the legend of the Resurrection and the legends of the Apostles testifying to the Resurrection and the legends of the Church Fathers testifying to the existence of the Apostles testifying to the Resurrection and so on is even less plausible than the Apostles just making up the legend of the Resurrection in the first place. Something must be going on.Well okay, this is not necessarily true; if there were a possible bottleneck in which the official church narrative passed through one person, that might provide a way out. I've been toying with the idea that St. Paul could be such a bottleneck if the Apostles never really left Palestine to confirm or deny what he told the Greek world, but I no longer think that's very plausible. So although I would welcome further speculation on St. Paul, from an atheist point of view it would be nice to have a good refutation of the original argument that the Apostolic testimony provides good evidence for Jesus.And to repeat, that argument is that if twelve people say they saw something miraculous and refused to recant despite persecution and strong self-interested reasons to do so - then we can trust them.One way to knock down this argument is to find a case of twelve people who said they saw something miraculous, didn't recant despite persecution and strong self-interested reasons to do so - and yet everyone, atheist and orthodox Christian alike, agree they were wrong. Ever since I left Utah I've been slowly making my way through The Mormon People, and I was very excited to find a case of exactly that.If you're not familiar with Mormonism, it was founded in the 1820s by an American prophet named Joseph Smith, who claimed that an angel led him to a series of golden tablets written in hieroglyphics which, when translated by means of a magic stone, contained various revelations. He attracted various followers despite persecution and today there are over ten million Mormons who believe the insights he took from these tablets and various other angelic encounters form a new testament of the Bible called The Book of Mormon.During Smith's lifetime, there was obviously a lot of curiosity over whether his story about angels and golden tablets and hieroglyphics was true. This was compounded by his insistence that he had given the golden tablets back to the angel when he was done translating them and so couldn't produce the originals for scholarly review anymore.However, Smith was able to produce eleven witnesses (besides himself, for a total of twelve) for his story. Three witnesses claimed to have seen the angel holding the plates and heard the Voice of God tell them Smith's story was true:Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, his brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who came from the tower of which hath been spoken. And we also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true. And we also testify that we have seeen [sic] the engravings which are upon the plates; and they have been shewn unto us by the power of God, and not of man. And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things are true. And it is marvellous [sic] in our eyes. Nevertheless, the voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear testimony of these things. And we know that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men, and be found spotless before the judgment-seat of Christ, and shall dwell with him eternally in the heavens. And the honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen.Eight others saw the plates later, and although they did not encounter God or any angels, they confirmed that there were a set of mysterious golden tablets with hieroglyphics on them:Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this work, has shewn unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with our hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship. And this we bear record with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shewn unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken. And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing witness of it.All eleven signed official legal statements swearing their testimony, which were later incorporated into printed editions of the Book of Mormon.What are we to make of this?One obvious possibility is that Smith made some fake tablets and showed them off to few enough people for a brief enough time that the fake couldn't be investigated closely. I don't like this explanation for two reasons. The first is that it would be really hard for a dirt-poor farmer to construct a book seemingly constructed of gold tablets inscribed with hieroglyphics. He would need the cooperation of a couple of professionals, and he would have to rely on them keeping quiet. Even moving the tablets - they were said to have weighed several hundred pounds - would have been a production. No goldsmith or wealthy backer has ever come forward claiming a part in it, nor have any likely candidates been proposed. And second of all, this is less parsimonious than most alternative hypotheses. It would require Smith to be pushing two totally different plots at the same time - whatever plot got the first group to testify to angels and divine voices, and the plot to fake a golden book for the second group.A second possibility is that Smith found a bunch of people who were willing to lie for him. But this suffers from the same problem that the "the Apostles lied" theory does. Several of the witnesses later had very public fallings-out with Joseph Smith and the incipient Mormon Church. Oliver Cowdery, one of the three who saw the angel, got into a fight with Joseph Smith over polygamy and some money matters and got excommunicated from Mormonism. He ended up moving to Ohio, becoming a Methodist, and declaring that he was "ashamed of his connection with Mormonism". However, he always stuck to his story about seeing the angel and the Golden Plates, even when, according to Wikipedia, "that confession cost him the editorship of a newspaper". David Whitmer, another of the three witnesses to the angel, also got in a spat with Joseph Smith and was part of a coup attempt in the Mormon church to expel Joseph Smith as leader and replace him with himself. Smith excommunicated him and then sent a militia to harass him and his family; eventually he was forced to leave the state. Although he denounced Smith for the rest of his life, he continued to swear that he had seen the angel and the golden plates.Further, the Mormons were getting persecuted ad nauseum by this point. On three different occasions, Mormon towns were burnt, the Mormons lost their land, and a bunch of Mormons were killed or jailed. Joseph Smith himself was killed by an angry mob. Eventually the Mormons got so sick and afraid that they all packed up and fled to Utah, which as anyone who's seen Utah knows requires a special level of desperation.This presents a serious problem for the Christian apologists, at least if they're not Mormon. Their argument is that there's no way twelve people would simultaneously hallucinate a mystical experience, and although twelve people might agree to lie about the mystical experience there's no way they would all keep that lie throughout decades of church politics and terrible persecution. But now they're faced with a dilemma. Either they have to throw out the argument that a dozen people testifying to something and holding to it means it definitely happened, or they all have to convert to Mormonism.So what did happen with all those witnesses to Mormonism? Well, there are a few helpful hints. All of them were strongly predisposed in Smith's favor to begin with. Some were his family members. All had a background in the sort of folk mysticism that was common in America at the time.(notice none of this differentiates it from the Jesus case; those who saw the resurrected Jesus were his disciples, some were members of his family such as his brother James, and they were all steeped in the folk mysticism that was common in Palestine at the time. But I digress)A number of the Mormon witnesses sort of change their stories in weird ways. One, Martin Harris, supposedly admitted later he saw the plate not with his earthly eyes but with his "eyes of faith", and a neighbor said he "never claimed to have seen the plates with his natural eyes, only spiritual vision". Then Harris totally denied ever saying this and said they were definitely literally real in every possible way. Another witness is supposedly on the record as saying the angel had "no form or shape" and was more of a "vague impression", although again he's also on the much more official record as totally denying this and saying it was all definitely really real. Apparently in contradiction to these, there is a record of one witness insisting he hefted the (quite heavy) plates and held them on his knees and felt the weight and so on.The Jesus story also has some weird incongruities. In many cases, the disciples originally thought they were talking to someone else (a gardener, a traveler on the road), and later "realize" it is Jesus. Jesus tells Mary not to touch him, suggesting some kind of belief he might be a vision or apparition, but then Thomas very specifically does touch him, suggesting an attempt to dispel this belief. Although the Christ story admittedly does not have the sort of guarded-then-retracted attempts by the witnesses to say maybe it was really spiritual after all, we also have only about a thousandth as much material in the Jesus case as in the Joseph Smith case, and we totally lack any independent testimony from the Apostles involved let alone any evidence that they were ever questioned harshly by skeptics or had things they mentioned to their neighbors come back to haunt them.Overall I think the Mormon experience proves (if you're not Mormon!) that the sort of psychological forces surrounding mystical experiences can be more complicated than we naively expect. We wouldn't expect twelve witnesses to swear up and down that they saw angels and magical golden plates and so on, and then stick to the story despite a host of opportunities to profit by denying it - and yet if we are to continue denying Mormonism we must admit exactly that. And coming to that conclusion should make us update our probabilities in the case of the Apostles as well.</div></div><hr><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" /></head>Page URL: http://squid314.livejournal.com/330483.htmlTitle: Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz - Family history</br>Author: Unknown</br><div><div>
Something my grandmother found recently in the archives of the New York Times, April 2 1948:Abraham Siskind was my great-grandfather. I obviously never got a chance to meet him. It's embarrassing to say, but I kind of picture him as Grandpa on the Simpsons, because hey, "Abraham Siskind" and "Abraham Simpson" sound a lot alike.According to family legend, Great-Grandpa Abraham came to America with his father, Great-Great-Grandpa Baruch. Great-Great-Grandpa Baruch went back to the old country because America was too irreligious and it was impossible to keep to the old ways. Great-Grandpa Abraham decided to stay.It didn't work out for either of them. Great-Great-Grandpa Baruch was killed in the Holocaust, and Great-Grandpa Abraham was killed in the robbery. The 1940s were apparently just a generally horrible time.The story passed down to me goes that his wife, Great-Grandma Ida, came to the trial to agitate for the death penalty for his murderers. When the jury asked for leniency, she yelled at them "I HOPE IT HAPPENS TO YOU!" on her way out of the courtroom.I spent about five minutes on Google trying to find out if any of the murderers had any living descendants. It proved impossible to track down. This is probably a good thing. If I had found them, what would I do? Send an email saying "Hey, your great-grandfather murdered my great-grandfather. So, tell me about yourself"? Would I even want to know? If they were nice people with spouses and families working as an elementary school teacher in a leafy suburb, would that be better or worse than if they were coke addicts going in and out of prison on a string of assault charges? The story passed down to me also says that Great-Grandpa Abraham was shot, which contradicts the Times article and its iron pipe. I tend to trust the newspaper over vague family tradition. The discrepancy is interesting, because I know I heard the gunshot-version at my Bar Mitzvah in '98, so it would have been only fifty years and Great-Uncle Dave, Great-Grandpa Abraham's son, would still have been alive at that time. It just goes to show that oral tradition gets corrupted really really quickly.</div></div><hr><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" /></head>Page URL: http://squid314.livejournal.com/330050.htmlTitle: Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz - Utilitarian jihad</br>Author: Unknown</br><div><div>

Nice to see! I have also been doing the thing where you try to give significant amounts of income to efficient charity and blog about it:http://blog.printf.net/articles/2011/12/01/charity-2011-editionLet us feel good and win status together, for great justice.Maybe LW is a better place for it, but it might be interesting to hear more about simultaneously supporting GiveWell and knowing that they (tentatively) think the nonprofit that you actually want to support the most is ineffective.Edited at 2012-09-21 09:53 am (UTC)
Oh yay, thank you for setting a good example.my current three-pronged strategyI think this is very sensible. I expect people to disagree with the details, but I think it's important to set up any sensible compromise.shouldn't I not be publicly talking about charityI think it's fine to be open and straightforward about giving, and it's a really good point to that it's good to establish different groups as charitable ones.I think there is a good reason people don't like to talk about it, because some people do talk about charitable giving in holier than though way, and make people who can't afford as much feel awful, and that's why some traditions tell you not to, but as long as people are just being open, and not saying "look at me, look how virtuous I am" while being a bastard in other ways, it's a good thing.
From a purely consequentialist perspective, aren't we all gonna die anyway? What's the point of anything?

The simple answer is that people flourishing and living lives they enjoy (and then dying at some point) is still better than people suffering and living lives they hate (and then dying). And sometimes it really is that simple.Even if there's an upper bound on how much can be achieved, I still prefer more to less.-orthonormal
Oh huzzah. I still haven't actually signed up to GWWC, cos I'm a bit nervous about a lifetime pledge, although I am currently giving 10%, and plan to do so indefinitely. I'm going entirely for SCI at the moment (2nd on Givewell, but more tax-efficient than AMF from the UK), although I think that the SIAI/CFAR type charities are a reasonable choice. I find it very hard to evaluate the probabilities.
It's worth pointing out, by the way, that the Baha'i stipulate 19% for your income _above_ your level of comfortable living; whereas the monotheistic religions tend to stipulate 10% on everything — c.f. the parable about the woman giving a few coppers from her poverty-level means.http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.1*x+%3D+0.19*%28x-1%29shows the progressions of the two approach, and we can see that you'd have to earn 211% of your comfort level before Baha'i starts being the more generous religion. Of course, once you have a job and make more money, you may be past the 211% threshold.
One notes that a poverty-stricken Jew, even one living on charity, must give some nominal amount to charity, but the tithe is not when you need it to support family members.
Personally I give to Catholic Relief Services mostly, because they are very efficient. (And I don't earmark it so they can use it mostly efficiently.)But if you really want a Rare Disease organization, well there is the National Organization for Rare Disorders.
I must note that time is not, in fact, utterly fungible. You can hit the point of diminishing returns in the office, you can go stir crazy sticking to your lathe, and you have to factor in that going to the soup kitchen can also provide moral support and express relationships that can't be done with money.
Good for you!I give to charity without examining it much -- but you've inspired me to switch to a Goodwill-approved charity. (I can't tithe -- I'm too worried of overspending and running out of money. Maybe someday when I'm more organized about my finances.)I wouldn't worry too much about SIAI one way or another. On the one hand, at current margins there are *so few people* working on AI safety that it's clearly beneficial to humanity to pay their salaries. There's some amount that's too much to spend on such research; but middle-class salaries for two people can't possibly be it. On the other hand, I think it's an overstatement to say that it's the most important charity in the world; we have to consider not only the *need* for AI safety (a quantity with really high error bars that include some really big numbers) but the *effectiveness* of SIAI at working on it. And they're just ordinary people, with foibles, and it's fair to be skeptical about their ability to solve the problem.I'd say: give if you're interested, don't feel guilty about it, but don't feel obligated to make it a #1 priority because there is a good case to be made that it shouldn't be. At any rate it's sort of a moot point; SIAI only needs so much money anyway, and once its needs are met, you can give the remainder to other things.
Oddly enough, I do *not* get any kind of good feeling or "fuzzies" from cute-puppies charity in the sense most people talk about. My brain is broken, I guess. The closest thing is that I like giving to organizations that serve me-and-people-like-me directly. Like Planned Parenthood, or math camps, or museums. Sort of, "Somebody nice paid for me to have something good; I want to pay it forward so that future mini-me's can have the same experience and so that the institution will still be around for me to enjoy." An investment in making the future world more suited to Sarah-values. I have a friend who gives to Amnesty International for the same reason. He's a political dissident of sorts, so he sees it less as "charity" than as investment in an institution that one day may save his ass. Or may help people who are enough like himself that he identifies with them.
I actually would not get warm fuzzies from a literal cute puppies charity because I would just feel like a gullible idiot. What I'm talking about is a charity that gives me the feeling of satisfying my morals. SIAI doesn't do that because I feel like it's probably wasted money (even if there's a small chance that it isn't in a big way). Against Malaria doesn't really do that because I'm not sure how utilitarian-useful it is to save the lives of some people who will probably live unpleasant lives and then go on to have children who are themselves just at risk of malaria as their parents and so it's kind of throwing water from a sinking ship.But a charity that directly and quickly improves people's lives will incentivize me to keep donating. I chose Helen Keller because they tend to do a lot of work curing blind people, and I can totally imagine how that would make a bunch of people really happy and improve their lives.
Why not give time and money directly to people you know? That way you would be sure of them going to good use. 
I've done that a little, but if you read the efficient charity links, well...I mostly know Americans, mostly around the middle class. It takes a lot of money to vastly improve their lives - for example, if a friend has cancer, it might take $50,000 to save their lives through health care donations.It takes almost no money to vastly improve the lives of poor Third Worlders. If they have malaria or something, they might be dying for lack of a $10 medication, so if I donate that $10 medication I've done just as much good as if I gave my First World friend the $50,000 cancer treatment, but for 1/5000th of the cost.Likewise, I could make my friend's whole month by buying them a new car or something for $20000, and I could make an African kid's whole month by buying them a month's worth of food for $20. Same effect, able to scale it up 1000x.Also, I actually trust a GiveWell approved charity that's gone through huge amounts of vetting and study more than many of my friends!

Scott's post had a lot of well-written and interesting content beyond "look at me, I donate to charity". If I recall correctly the post you wrote, the same was not true of it.It's like saying "why did you all laugh at his artfully constructed joke, but not laugh when I shouted 'MONKEY BALLS'? We were both trying to be funny!"-orthonormal
This makes sense, so I made a similar post: http://www.jefftk.com/news/2012-09-21Edited at 2012-09-22 12:12 am (UTC)

What I have to say about this comes from a kind of nasty, defensive place, but I think it makes sense anyway. Promoting a pledge of "I'll donate 10% of my income to charity" seems rankly hypocritical when it's done by someone who is devoting most of their resources to private goods other than money. The cleanest example might be Toby Ord, who as I recall founded GWWC while he was a grad student in philosophy and now appears to be on some kind of post-doc research fellowship. Now Toby Ord is (evidently) a high-IQ self-starter -- he could develop his talents and earn a high wage in the marketplace if he wanted to. If, counterfactually, he had devoted himself more to making money, he might not have become one of the richest people in the world, but he could probably earn an upper-class income for more or less his whole life. I think lifetime earnings of USD$10M is a somewhat conservative estimate. Instead he has decided to undertake an academic lifestyle, where as a grad student and fellow he has probably taken home incomes in the low five figures, and as a professor he can hope to earn low-six-figures when he reaches full seniority, perhaps years down the road. Now I don't want to make the straightforward utilitarian argument that one should maximize their income so they can maximize their giving -- I'm really only meaning to talk about the "ickiness" here, for better or worse; hypocrisy is a form of "ickiness."But think about it this way. Instead of the money he might have earned as an engineer or an investment banker, Toby Ord is compensated for his professional work in other ways. He receives the intellectual stimulation of inquiry in a field he finds interesting; long vacations and sabbaticals; the prestige associated with academia; job security; educational benefits and tuition breaks for any children you have; etc. Imagine that Toby Ord is getting paid a lifetime income of USD$2M, as well as an additional lifetime 8M Academic Fuzzyons. Every year he gets paid a small number of dollars and a larger hoard of Academic Fuzzyons. He gives away 10% of the dollars and keeps all the Fuzzyons himself. Over his lifetime he will give away USD$200K and no Fuzzyons, out of his total earnings of USD$2M and 8M Fuzzyons -- so it looks like Ord is really only giving away 200K / 10M = 2% of his lifetime earnings. Most of the wealth he produces in his lifetime is sheltered in Fuzzyons, which he privately consumes while urging others to give away their dollars. Consider by contrast someone who is earning more of their product in money compensation: Toby's evil cousin, Oby Tord, corporate lawyer. Oby Tord has the same productive capacity as Toby Ord but he is choosing to earn it in money instead of untraceable Fuzzyons. As a corporate lawyer, he will make lifetime earnings of $10M. A 10% tithe would yield $1M of giving, but Oby Tord doesn't really want to tithe. Toby Ord would have to tithe 50% to give that much. Isn't Oby Tord within his rights to criticize his cousin for advocating generosity while behaving like a skinflint?

Note also that Fuzzyons as described above are mostly tax-free. Factor in even slightly progressive taxation (i.e. linear on income) and the dynamic described above becomes even sharper.
That's lovely news. Seeing as you wrote two of my favorite essays on giving, I had been wondering what your approach in real life was.

Wouldn't it be more efficient to just occasionally give five bucks to random feel-good charities instead of allocating money for large, infrequent donations, thus giving you more frequent warm fuzzies for less cost?
Because there is the warm fuzzy background knowledge that one is the person who gives on a regular basis, which also adds meaning to one's life?
Without exception, any time I tell anyone that I am doing something, my motivation to do it decreases. I also have a powerful urge to tell people what I am doing. I am wary of the advice to boast about giving.

This is a common problem, Patri Friedman wrote a Post about it on LessWrong: http://lesswrong.com/lw/z8/image_vs_impact_can_public_commitment_be/
Reading this made me decide to increase my giving.
Well done!I used to have the goal of eventually spending one third of my after-rent-and-taxes income on charity, but now that I'm working for SIAI, actually *donating* money seems a little pointless since I can just bill them less instead.
I'm sort of having the same problem with working for them. Not really sure what to do about it. Billing them less seems kind of silly.
Hey, satisfying emotional needs can generate utility too.

Comments:
For what it's worth, I've found the posts useful. They articulate a lot of things I have felt and complained about in private, but does so significantly more thoroughly than I have or probably would. I agree that they don't in themselves propose any useful solutions, but I think that was inevitable. It's pretty hard to actually "solve" complex social problems, except by getting people to think differently and consequently behave differently. Hopefully the fact that they exist will in some small way improve things.RE rationalists: I'm a small r rationalist in the same way I'm a small f feminist. Broadly supportive of the general idea, disagree on a few of the specifics, sufficiently put off by the community that I don't feel particularly inclined to join in as a semi-heretical member. I suspect there are a lot of us. 
"These people are trigger-happy with their conceptual superweapon, and they're everywhere!" Okay, but if you say that, and everyone either agrees with you or else disagrees in an excruciatingly polite and rational manner, that sort of undermines the arguments.ROFL! Thank you. And yes, I've been very impressed at how very high the signal to noise ratio was.I disagreed with some of it, but I thought it had some very good ideas, and very amusing writing, and a lot of interesting responses. I think getting a lot of attention is a perk of writing interesting things about a controversial topic. It's an abuse if you just write the same things again and again and pretend they're interesting. But if you're saying something interesting, you have no reason to feel guilty because surprisingly many people were interested :)That said, I did expect some vociferous disagreement. I think your criticisms of social-justice-type feminism are apt (and I know many feminists who I think would agree), but I also think social-justice-type feminism does identify many real problems that most other people don't recognise, and your post sounds dismissive of them (even if that's not what you meant), which is indeed likely to piss many people off.At one of the Cambridge UK less wrong meetings we had a conversation about introducing feminist concepts to rationalists and vice versa, which wasn't perfect, but went better than I expected and was surprisingly interesting.
I've long been hoping someone will write a series of "feminism for lesswrongers" posts for the site.I guess I need to work on my telepathy, as it hasn't happened yet. I did an extremely limited amount of research intending to have a go myself, but didn't find any good sources.
I need to come to one of the Cambridge LW meets again sometime :).
"-- I continue to underestimate the universality of the law that there is no argument so dumb or straw-mannish that someone somewhere has not made it."I think you want to link to a specific comment about bad Bible arguments?I hadn't heard of "social justice feminism" before, though I knew there were many strains of feminism; now I'm a bit annoyed because I associate "social justice" with economic equality concerns like _The Spirit Level_.It's been an interesting series, though I'll be thankful to not have a long post on feminism in my friends page every day, it was starting to feel "oh no not another one already".But you might make one last post indexing the series for handy reference.
"Has been arrested for a violent crime" isn't the same thing as "is a rapist". One is about perception and the other other is about actual behavior.I'm moderately sure that that the sort of attack (at least about race) you've been working on undermining is more likely to happen to sf authors. More generally, I think think it might be fair to say that the social justice conceptual superweapons have been spreading, but the influence of those superweapons is much less than it feels like if you happen to hang out in places where they're common. 
Either this is another one of those weird dreams, or you are all the best people ever.You too. :)&lt;3
-- People who discuss the "war on women" or who seemingly uncharitably oppose people who make various policy proposals as "misogynist" are not just unreflectively failing to exercise charity. They have actually considered the situation and decided that charity is not deserved. I don't know if that's better or worse.Oh, I'm sure there are plenty of people who are indeed unreflectively failing to apply charity, too.
...yeah, the aleithometer came up "meaningless". It turns out I never actually made any concrete statements. No moral prescriptions. No suggestions for things that would be better. I'm not sure I have them, either - I was planning on making some, but now I'm not sure about them. And now that a bunch of people have posted this all over the Internet I'm trying to figure out what the heck I thought I was doing.What you did do, however, is describe the problem very well, which is valuable. If it were an easy problem to solve, it would have been solved already. As H. L. Menken once said, for every complex problem, there's a solution that is simple, neat, and wrong.
"If it were an easy problem to solve, it would have been solved already."(Abstract tangent)Depends on what you frame as the problem. Lots of social problems have easy solutions on their own merits; the problem is implementing solutions against opposition, not designing solutions. So arguably the real problem is "how do we do X given opposition", because *it* is the real political problem, but the political opposition is often complicating what's a simple utilitarian problem with a simple, neat, and correct -- but unpalatable -- solution.(See slavery as an extreme example. Simple neat and easy: ban slavery. But slaveowners had power. Reforming economic privileges and rents in general is often similar: good economic policy would be simple, but lots of people can block implementation out of self-interest.)

Not meaningless, this should be a prerequisite for anyone wanting to have a productive discussion with an identity politician (and who isn't an identity politician?). Most everyone gets stuck at the object level in these types of discussions, and they go nowhere. It's important to understand at the meta-level what you're actually doing and where you are, otherwise you'll end up somewhere you never intended or sputtering about in circles. I'd sum up these posts as "hey, let's take a step back and examine this like rational adults, because too often we miss the forest for the trees."
You learned something from it. That's awesome.
I hope this doesn't come off as patronizing, but your list of things learned was somewhat surprising to me-- it's partly evidence of how much people can miss because they're panicking and/or are getting information from other people who are panicking. (Ok, I'm guessing about the motivation, but it's the only guess I've got.)You're intelligent and benevolent, but it still took a lot of thought and sticking your neck out to discover both that there are many sorts of feminism and that the current round of SJ feminism is a response to some actual problems.I don't think you're mistaken about the existence of conceptual superweapons (thanks for the terminology), and I do think that there are feminists and anti-racists building new ones. 
+1 enlightening. Just looking through all my previous comments, I don't think I mentioned just how educational this whole conversation has been. Thanks!
I found the use of 'Nice Guy (TM)' throughout these posts somewhat uncharitable, given that in every other context that I can recall seeing the term (which, admittedly, may be an inadvertently biased attempt at recall) it has been used to refer to the type of person who expects that his nice behavior will be rewarded with romance or sex. The implied problem isn't being interested in a romantic relationship with a friend, it's supplying friendship and building emotional dependence as a means of eventually making someone feel obligated to follow through with a relationship they don't really want.
I think I've addressed that point already, but part of the problem is that the phrase was co-opted from men who used it in a completely different way, and then used to prove that the men who were using it in a different way were wrong and bad people.
Have you seen specific people being talked about as 'Nice Guy (TM)'? I've seen it happen a lot online and quite often the guy in question isn't obviously expecting sex. I've seen it used on guys who were venting frustrations, who were asking advice on behalf of a female friend who kept having bad relationships, and on guys who hadn't been able to get a date for years and were wondering what they were doing wrong. They get called creepy based on pattern matching, and there's no defense from a 'Nice Guy (TM)' accusation. 
Hmm... I just realized that with these posts, you may actually have provided a superweapon against superweapons. In other words, if somebody accuses somebody of "mansplaining" or "privilege" or whatever, the other can resort to "superweapon!" and a link to these posts.Which, in turn, gives me the belated realization that what you call "superweapons" is what Paul Graham is talking about when he talks about heresy, and that "using a superweapon against superweapons" is basically the same as his "political correctness" defense:One way to do this is to ratchet the debate up one level of abstraction. If you argue against censorship in general, you can avoid being accused of whatever heresy is contained in the book or film that someone is trying to censor. You can attack labels with meta-labels: labels that refer to the use of labels to prevent discussion. The spread of the term "political correctness" meant the beginning of the end of political correctness, because it enabled one to attack the phenomenon as a whole without being accused of any of the specific heresies it sought to suppress.(Apologies if this has already been pointed out somewhere in your comments, or is just otherwise incredibly obvious.)Edited to add:Graham also points out one encouraging thing about superweapons - they tend to become overused and then lose their power over time:In every period of history, there seem to have been labels that got applied to statements to shoot them down before anyone had a chance to ask if they were true or not. "Blasphemy", "sacrilege", and "heresy" were such labels for a good part of western history, as in more recent times "indecent", "improper", and "unamerican" have been. By now these labels have lost their sting. They always do. By now they're mostly used ironically. But in their time, they had real force.The word "defeatist", for example, has no particular political connotations now. But in Germany in 1917 it was a weapon, used by Ludendorff in a purge of those who favored a negotiated peace. At the start of World War II it was used extensively by Churchill and his supporters to silence their opponents. In 1940, any argument against Churchill's aggressive policy was "defeatist". Was it right or wrong? Ideally, no one got far enough to ask that.And he also suggests that if a group is in a position where it ends up employing conceptual superweapons, it's in a position of weakness, so their victory is not inevitable. Even if the group wins, that may lead to an eventual decline in the power of their superweapon:To launch a taboo, a group has to be poised halfway between weakness and power. A confident group doesn't need taboos to protect it. It's not considered improper to make disparaging remarks about Americans, or the English. And yet a group has to be powerful enough to enforce a taboo. Coprophiles, as of this writing, don't seem to be numerous or energetic enough to have had their interests promoted to a lifestyle.I suspect the biggest source of moral taboos will turn out to be power struggles in which one side only barely has the upper hand. That's where you'll find a group powerful enough to enforce taboos, but weak enough to need them.Though of course, by the time that the superweapon of one group loses its power, the mad scientists of another are busy putting the finishing touches on their own...Edited at 2012-09-20 09:34 am (UTC)

I'm an MRA (boo, hiss, I know) and I've just spent the past hour or so reading your last 9 posts in this series (I found the link here (http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/106ftc/for_those_who_have_absorbed_the_associated_memes/)) in case you were curious). When I saw this was a Livejournal blog, I was expecting another piece of crap because, well, Livejournal is filled with crap...instead I found brilliance. I decided to leave a comment because I wanted to let you know how much I appreciated what you've written...not only for your well-reasoned criticisms of the people who hate me, but also because you've led me to reconsider some of my own reactions/etc. as well as some of what I see emerging in the MRM. I am, and will continue to be, an antifeminist -- the reasons for which I've outlined here (https://femintology.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/why-im-an-antifeminist/) -- however, I'm going to try to be a bit more cautious about "super-weapons", as I do see something like that coming together within the MRM (though, as far as I know, we don't have any bingo cards...yet).I also wanted to touch on something else: I agree with everything you've written from this (http://squid314.livejournal.com/327849.html) to this (http://squid314.livejournal.com/329561.html)...except for "patriarchy". I don't think it's a useful term for describing modern western cultures. First, there are major issues with falsifiability. Specifically, there are a bunch of different definitions for the term "patriarchy" ranging from the extremely vague and unfalsifiable, to the very specific and falsifiable...and the more falsifiable it gets, the more it gets falsified (http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/e2vme/im_trying_to_put_together_a_solid_refutation_of/), while the vague and unfalsifiable definitions (e.g. "an unjust social system that is oppressive to women") are useless and don't really support much of the rhetoric criticizing "patriarchy" (especially those criticisms which closely resemble conspiracy theories).Anyway, "patriarchy" is just a pet-peeve of mine. I really did enjoy reading your posts, and appreciate you taking the time (and risk) to share your thoughts on this complicated and controversial grouping of inter-related subjects.P.S. I think you should consider compiling all of these posts into a single essay, and perhaps releasing an e-book version. I'm not sure of the "right" way to make an e-book, but if you have Open Office and Calibre, you can export a PDF from Open Office and convert it to a usable .mobi/.epub in Calibre.
I found this series interesting, and respectful-whilst-disagreeing; others may disagree but I think your thoughtfulness is a reason you didn't get superweaponed all over the shop (also the way you said these things *in your own space* not as a direct response in someone else's space where they may have looked more like a direct attack on an individual).I always think there's things to be learned from sitting down and listening to people one disagrees with; but it does take a degree of patience and courage that not everyone is fortified with at all times (or even ever). 
People who discuss the "war on women" or who seemingly uncharitably oppose people who make various policy proposals as "misogynist" are not just unreflectively failing to exercise charity. They have actually considered the situation and decided that charity is not deserved. I don't know if that's better or worse.Third option: they believe that women were and are expected to exercise the Principle of Charity more than men. In the most extreme form, this means that refusing to be charitable while female is itself a blow against the patriarchy. In a milder form, it manifests as requiring serious evidence your opponent has thought through your position in a charitable manner first, before doing the same. Social justice feminists are more likely to believe this and more likely to take a more extreme form.I think it's hard to deny that this was true historically, and is still at least somewhat true today, especially when it comes to dating. That is why I reacted so strongly to the comment thread on how to schedule a date. "I know this pattern matches with people who are stalkerish or boring, but you should investigate before turning me down." is essentially demanding the principle of charity be applied, and I resented the implication that women were bad people if they didn't bear that investigation cost.
This series of posts was the first critique of feminism that actually made me considering distancing myself from the term. Thanks for that. But in the end, I'm not willing to surrender feminism to unreasonable people. http://jdwise.blogspot.com/2011/08/between-rock-and-crunchy-place.html

Of things you've discussed, conceptual superweapons seems like a particularly useful idea. This concept is another powerful heuristic for activating rationalist taboo, perhaps powerful enough to navigate mindkilling topics (it also partially overlaps the less clear heuristic from the Worst Argument in the World). It seems worth extracting from the context and writing up as an article.
Another self-defeating argument – or statement, rather – is “It goes without saying that [whatever]”. If it really went without saying, you wouldn’t have to say it. It is more accurate to say “It should go without saying that [whatever]”.</div></div><hr><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" /></head>Page URL: http://squid314.livejournal.com/329561.htmlTitle: Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz - The Eighth Meditation on Superweapons and Bingo</br>Author: Unknown</br><div><div>
 I usually blog about a mix of philosophy, medicine, and random things that go on in my personal life. According to my LiveJournal Statistics page, a typical blog post of mine from last month when I was blogging every day and about writing really interesting stuff like meeting a guy possessed by demons got eight hundred page views per day by about a hundred fifty LiveJournal users a day. As soon as I started writing about gender, it shot up to about twenty-five hundred page views by three hundred fifty users a day. On the one hand, I like popularity as much as anyone else. On the other hand, I feel like by writing on a hot-button issue and taking a side on the object-level debate, I'm kind of doing something sort of dirty; like now I'm only one or two levels above those blogs that write "The Democrats suck, because they love Big Government! LOL!" and get a million subscribers a day. So I will make one final object-level post today, a meta-level post tomorrow, and then try to limit myself to at absolute most one culture war per week from now on.<p>I</p>
<p>Sometimes people complain that it's scary how oblivious the other side is to their arguments. But I know something scarier.</p>
<p>On r/atheism, a Christian-turned-atheist once described an "apologetics" group at his old church. The pastor would bring in a simplified straw-man version of a common atheist argument, they'd take turns mocking it ("Oh my god, he said that monkeys can give birth to humans! That's hilarious!") and then they'd all have a good laugh together. Later, when they met an actual atheist who was trying to explain evolution to them, they wouldn't sit and evaluate it dispassionately. They'd pattern-match back to the ridiculous argument they heard at church, and instead of listening they'd be thinking "Hahaha, atheists really are that hilariously stupid!"</p>
<p>Of course, it's not only Christians who do that. I hear atheists repeat the old "I believe the Bible because God said it was true. We know He said it was true because it's in the Bible. And I believe the Bible because God said it is true" line constantly and grin as if they've said something knee-slappingly funny. I've never in my entire life heard a Christian use this reasoning. I have heard Christians use the "truth-telling thing" argument sometimes (we should believe the Bible because the Bible is correct about many things that can be proven independently, this vouches for the veracity of the whole book, and therefore we should believe it even when it can't be independently proven) many times. If you're familiar enough with the atheist version, and uncharitable enough to Christians, you will pattern-match, miss the subtle difference, and be thinking "Hahaha, Christians really are as hilariously stupid as all my atheist friends say!"</p>
<p>Sometimes even the straw-man argument is unnecessary. All you need to do is get in a group and make the other side's argument a figure of fun.</p>
<p>There are lots of good arguments against libertarianism. I have collected some of them into a very long document which remains the most popular thing I've ever written. But when I hear liberals discuss libertarianism, they very often head in the same direction. They make a silly face and say "Durned guv'mint needs to stay off my land!" And then all the other liberals who are with them laugh uproariously. And then when a real libertarian shows up and makes a real libertarian argument, a liberal will adopt his posture, try to mimic his tone of voice, and say "Durned guv'ment needs to stay off my land! Hahaha!" And all the other liberals will think "Hahaha, libertarians really are that stupid!"</p>
<p>Many of you will recognize this as much like the Myers Shuffle. As long as a bunch of atheists get together and laugh at religious people who ask them to read theology before criticizing it, and as long as they have an easily recognizable name for the object of their hilarity like "Courtier's Reply", then whenever a religious person asks them to familiarize themselves with theology the atheist can just say "Courtier's Reply!" and all the other atheists will crack up and think "Hahaha, religious people really are that stupid!" and they gain status and the theist loses status and at no point do they have to even consider responding to the theist's objection.</p>
<p>This tendency reaches its most florid manifestation in the "ideological bingo games". See for example "Skeptical Sexist Bingo", feminist bingo, libertarian troll bingo, anti-Zionist bingo, pro-Zionist bingo, and so on. If you Google for these you can find thousands, which is too bad because every single person who makes one of these is going to Hell.</p>
<p>Let's look at the fourth one, "Anti-Zionist Bingo." Say that you mention something bad Israel is doing, someone else accuses you of being anti-Semitic, and you correct them that no, not all criticism of Israel is necessarily anti-Semitic and you're worried about the increasing tendency to spin it that way.</p>
<p>And they say "Hahahahahhaa he totally did it, he used the 'all criticism of Israel gets labeled anti-Semitic' argument, people totally use that as a real argument hahahaha they really are that stupid, I get 'B1' on my stupid stereotypical critics of Israel bingo!"</p>
<p>You say "Uh, look, I'm not really sure what you're getting at. I recognize that there is real anti-Semitism and I am just as opposed to it as you are but surely when when see the state excusing acts of violence against Palestinians in the West Bank we..."</p>
<p>And they say "Hahahhaha G1, I got G1, he pulled the old 'I abhor real anti-Semitism' line this is great, guys come over here and look at what this guy is doing he's just totally parroting all the old arguments every anti-Semite uses!"</p>
<p>So it may be scary when your opponent is unaware of your arguments, but it is much scarier when your opponent has a sort of vague dreamlike awareness of your arguments, which immediately pattern-match cached thoughts about how horrible a person you would have to be to make them.</p>
<p>But this is still not the scariest thing.</p>
<p>Because if your opponent brings out the Bingo card, you can just tell them exactly what I am saying here. You can explain to the pro-Israel person that they are pattern-matching your responses, that you don't know what strawman anti-Zionist they're thinking of but that you have legitimate reasons for believing what you do and you request a fair hearing, and that if they do not repent of their knee-slapping pattern-matching Bingo-making ways they are going to Hell.</p>
<p>No, the scariest thing would be if one of those bingo cards had, in the free space in the middle: "You are just pattern-matching my responses. I swear that I have something legitimate to tell you which is not just a rehash of the straw-man arguments you've heard before, so please just keep an open mind and hear me out."</p>
<p>If someone did that, even Origen would have to admit they were beyond any hope of salvation. Any conceivable attempt to explain their error would be met with a "Hahahaha he did the 'stop-pattern matching I'm not a strawman I'm not an inhuman monster STOP FILLING OUT YOUR DAMN BINGO CARD' thing again! He's so hilarious, just like all those other 'stop-pattern matching I am not a strawman' people whom we know only say that because they are inhuman monsters!"</p>
<p>But surely no one could be that far gone, right?</p>
<p>Listen:</p>
<p>"I'm not racist, but..."</p>
<p>If you are like everyone else on the Internet, your immediate response is "Whoever is saying that is obviously a racisty racist who loves racism! I can't believe he literally used the 'I'm not racist, but...' line in those exact words! The old INRB! I've got to get home as fast as I can to write about this on my blog and tell everyone I really met one of those people!"</p>
<p>But why would someone use INRB? It sounds to me like what they are saying is: "Look. I know what I am saying is going to sound racist to you. You're going to jump to the conclusion that I'm a racist and not hear me out. In fact, maybe you've been trained to assume that the only reason anyone could possibly assert it is racism and to pattern-match this position to a racist straw man version. But I actually have a non-racist reason for saying it. Please please please for the love of Truth and Beauty just this one time throw away your prejudgments and your Bingo card and just listen to what I'm going to say with an open mind."</p>
<p>And so you reply "Hahahaha! He really used the 'look I know what I'm saying is going to sound racist to you you're going to jump to the conclusion that I'm a racist and not hear me out in fact maybe you've been trained to assume...' line! What a racist! Point and laugh, everyone! POINT AND LAUGH!"</p>
<p>And of course "sexist" works just as well as "racist" here, even though the latter is more familiar.</p>
<p>This is what I mean by "conceptual superweapon". This is what it looks like to stare into the barrel of a gigantic lunar-based death ray and abandon all hope. This is why I find feminism and the social justice community in general so scary.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Let's switch topics. Let's switch to medical testing. Although Medical Testing For Biochemists is complicated and involves scary words like "pharmacokinetics", Medical Testing for Doctors is much easier and goes like this:</p>
<p>A Magic Mystery Box fell to Earth during an eerie thunderstorm. If we wave the Magic Mystery Box over a patient, it beeps and displays a number from one to one hundred. Now sometimes low-numbered patients have cancer, and sometimes high-numbered patients are healthy, but in general the higher the number the more likely the patient is to have cancer. Sometimes.</p>
<p>Suppose the doctor has two choices. She can refer the patient to surgery, where surgeons will cut him open, look to see if there really is a cancer, and if so try to take it out. This surgery is expensive, unpleasant, and there's always the chance the surgeon's hand will slip and cut something important and the patient will die.</p>
<p>Or the doctor can say "Oh, you don't really have cancer" and do nothing.</p>
<p>If she tells a patient who has cancer that he's healthy, the patient will die, sue the doctor, or both. If she tells a patient who is healthy that he needs to go to surgery for further cancer investigation, she makes the patient needlessly terrified, wastes the surgeon's time, risks complications from the surgery, and costs the health system thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>So she waves the Magic Mystery Box over the patient, and it beeps and says "22". Now what?</p>
<p>In practice, doctors establish a threshold. The threshold will be a number like "40". If the test is above 40, the patient gets surgery. If the test is below 40, they send the patient home. </p>
<p>How does one choose the right threshold? A low threshold means means that doctors will catch almost all cancer, but they'll also end up sending a lot of healthy people for dangerous unnecessary surgery. A high threshold means that few healthy patients will ever suffer the risks of unnecessary surgery, but probably a lot of cancer will go undetected.</p>
<p>If the surgery is really dangerous but the cancer isn't that bad, the doctors will choose a high threshold. If the surgery is quick and safe but the uncaught cancer would be fatal, the doctors will choose a low threshold. But no matter what number they choose, all they can do is minimize the harm. Unless they sent every single patient of theirs to surgery, there will always be a few cancers that are uncaught. Unless they never send anyone to surgery, there will always be a few false alarms. As long as the test itself is imperfect, the doctors' decision will always unfairly harm a few patients. They just need to figure the threshold that harms as few as possible.</p>
<p>(If you're familiar with statistics, you already recognize this situation as Type I and Type II errors. If you're familiar with utilitarianism, you already recognize the solution as setting the threshold to maximize total utility across all patients. I'm not saying anything new here.)</p>
<p>If a doctor uses the established thresholds and refers a patient to surgery that turns out to be unnecessary, there are laws preventing that patient from suing her. The same is true if all the tests came back below the threshold, she said he was fine, and he later turned out to be super unlucky and have a totally undetectable form of cancer. The doctor did everything right. She just got unlucky. Those laws are really good. If they didn't exist, it would either be impossible to practice medicine, or else doctors would be optimizing for not being sued rather than for doing good medicine even more than they already are. If they only existed in one direction (eg doctors who did unnecessary surgeries couldn't be sued, but doctors who missed cancer could), that would be even worse - any doctor not heroic enough to go against her own self-interest would refer every patient to surgery.</p>
<p>Politics is nowhere near as rational as medicine. Politicians don't think in terms of thresholds. No one ever says "The more regulations we put on businesses, the fewer customers will get scammed by shady con men. But also the more likely it is that we unnecessarily penalize honest businesses. So we need to find the threshold value that minimizes the total unfairness to businesses and customers." Instead they say either "We need to fight for more regulations and anyone who says otherwise is in the pay of Big Business!" or "We need to cut through all the red tape and anyone who says otherwise is in the pay of Big Government!"</p>
<p>No one ever says "The more restrictions we place on welfare, the more certain we'll be that no one is abusing the system. But the more restrictions we place on welfare, the more certain we will be that some poor people who desperately need it can't get it. Therefore, we should determine the relative disutilities of people defrauding us and of needy people not being able to use the system, and act to maximize total utility." Instead they say "Anyone who opposes tight welfare restrictions is a welfare queen trying to scam you!" or "Anyone who wants any welfare restrictions hates poor people!"</p>
<p>Gender issues also involve thresholds.</p>
<p>A man who wants to know whether it is okay to ask a woman out can try to read her social cues and appeal to lists of known social norms. This is his Magic Mystery Box. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. He needs to set a threshold for action: how open to an advance does she has to look before he asks her or flirts with her or whatever. If the threshold is too low, he will be a creep and she will feel harrassed. If the threshold is too high, no one will ever ask anyone else out and everyone will die alone and unloved.</p>
<p>Another man is in love. He wants to know if he can express his love to a woman without worrying that it is "creepy" or "coming on too strong". Again social cues give him a Magic Mystery Box. Again he must set a threshold. If the threshold is too low, he will end up creeping people out. If the threshold is too high, then no one can ever be in love and all couples must be formed by deciding the other person is good-looking and so you will settle for them.</p>
<p>We need to dismantle social structures that favor men aka patriarchy. It's kind of hard to figure out which ones those are - is the preponderance of male math professors because of the patriarchy, or something else? We can run studies and surveys of women in the math field and try to get some preliminary conclusions - our Magic Mystery Box. But we need some threshold for intervention like fixing a quota of 50% women mathematicians in every college. If our threshold is too low, we end up with tokenism and promoting unqualified people. If our threshold is too high, we end up perpetuating the patriarchy.</p>
<p>Some men (and women!) express political positions whose consequences could hurt women. It's unclear whether they support those positions because they honestly believe they are good for society, or because they are evil people who deliberately aim at misogyny. We can psychoanalyze them - our Magic Mystery Box - but we must decide a threshold. If the threshold is too low, evil misogynists can get away with their evil misogyny and no one will call them on it. If the threshold is too high, we will end up demonizing a bunch of random people, giving feminism a reputation as "those people who go around demonizing innocents", and totally destroy any chance at friendly political discourse.</p>
<p>No threshold should ever be set at zero. If a doctor sets the Magic Mystery Box threshold to zero, then she will end up referring every single patient for dangerous surgery. "Doctor, I've been having a bit of a sore throat these past few....SURGERY! NOW!"</p>
<p>But if one side has a superweapon, it's impossible to argue for the other. If the threshold starts at forty, and one doctor says "But we can't be the sorts of monsters who would refuse a potential cancer patient live-saving surgery!", and this argument is a deeply-ingrained part of medical culture and the other doctors don't want to be tarred as cancer-sympathizers, then the threshold goes to 30. Then another doctor brings up the same argument, and the threshold goes to 20. Soon the threshold is at zero and they're referring rashes and hay fever for surgery and no one can protest because they don't want to look Pro-Cancer.</p>
<p>If it is impossible to ever say "You know, the social justice people make some good points, but on this issue here they've gone too far," then the threshold on all of those questions above just keeps inching downward until it hits zero.</p>
<p>And if people are punished for their results rather than their actions - if you can get called a creep even though you did your best to take her hints and followed all the rules - then that's like only suing the doctors who miss cancer. It's going to bring the threshold down to the zero "operate on everyone" level even faster.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>When I Googled for good examples of those bingo games to post above, it was pretty hard to find the Zionism ones and so on. Almost every ideological bingo game out there was feminist. This is not a coincidence.</p>
<p>For those who have absorbed the associated memes, feminism is a fully general conceptual superweapon. It has attempted and probably completed the task of making every possible counterargument so unthinkable that any feminist can refute it just by reciting the appropriate bingo square, then pointing and laughing.</p>
<p>If a man thinks women are less oppressed than she claims, she can say "male privilege!" and point and laugh.</p>
<p>If a man thinks there are some areas where the threshold has moved too far toward women, she can make a grave expression and intone "What About Teh Menz?" (now the name of a major blog, which is actually pretty good) and point and laugh.</p>
<p>If a man thinks parts of the reason why some men are jerks toward women is because women actually are more likely to date jerks than people who are respectful, she can gleefully declare "You're a Nice Guy (TM) and therefore Worse Than Hitler (TM)!" and point and laugh.</p>
<p>If a man tries to explain his own perspective to her or provide any alternative theory to men-being-horrible, she can say he's "mansplaining again!" and point and laugh.</p>
<p>If a man asks not to be immediately pattern-matched to the nearest hostile cliche when he tries to present his opinion, she can say he's using a variant of the old "I'm not sexist, but..." line. And point. And laugh.</p>
<p>During the past few days, some people have criticized me for nonstandard use of terms. They have tried to tell me that the legitimate definition of a feminist term isn't a bingo-square demonization that can be used to shut down debate, but [complex legitimate reasonable definition]. Well, okay. I agree all of these words have possible legitimate definitions and uses and were created for good reasons. The same is true of the word "Communist". It means a person who supports a classless society with common ownership of all goods. This has nothing to do with "communist" the way it is used in actual American political discourse eg "Obama is a communist because he wants universal health care!" If I criticize the Republicans for using the word "communism" as a debate-stopper, saying "But in this here dictionary Communist has a legitimate and useful meaning" is not a response. People created the word because it was useful and meaningful. Then it got picked up and placed into the fuel chamber of a superweapon. Now it is ten million degrees and radioactive and bears no resemblance to its former self. You might not find the terms above used in exactly the way above in the Official Oxford Dictionary Of Gender Relations, but I did check Google and urbandictionary.com to make sure that I wasn't completely generalizing from my own experience here.</p>
<p>My view on feminism isn't really driven by my view on gender relations or women or men or society. It's driven by my view on applause lights, on inability to urge restraint, on death spirals, on anti-charity, on zero-threshold medical testing, on superweapons, and most of all on epistemic hygiene. I don't care how righteous your cause is, you don't get a superweapon so powerful it can pre-emptively vaporize any possible counterargument including the one asking you to please turn off your superweapon and listen for just a second. No one should be able to do that.</p>
<p>I apologize for this post being so long. I wanted to make sure it wouldn't fit on a bingo board.</p>

 Suppose the President gets asked to veto a new hydroelectric dam. After thinking it over, he does so. He says the dam would destroy the environment and flood many homes. And the people ask him "Why do you hate Italians so much?"<p>What?</p>
<p>Well, if there's no hydroelectric plant, they have to make that energy some other way. A lot of it will be from fossil fuels. Fossil fuels contribute to global warming. Global warming raises sea levels. Rising sea levels are destroying Venice. The destruction of Venice will end the livelihoods of thousands of Italians. So if the President vetoes the dam, the best explanation is that he hates Italian people.</p>
<p>This isn't just an example of not using the Principle of Charity. No one uses the Principle of Charity. I push the Principle of Charity endlessly and think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread and toy with tattooing "Principle of Charity, people!" in big letters on my chest so that whenever people go on one of their demonization trips I can just take off my shirt and they'll be like "Oh, sorry". And even I forget to use the Principle of Charity most of the time, because it's really hard. But this is something way more malignant. This is like an active Principle of Anti-Charity here.</p>
<p>The Principle of Anti-Charity can do anything. No matter what the President's next move is, we can make that part of the War On Italians as well. Does the President cut the military budget? The US is the core of NATO; any decrease in US forces will have to be compensated by the other NATO countries if the alliance is to stay strong. Therefore Italy has to invest more money in defense, dealing another blow to its already crumbling economy. Shame on the President and his Italian-hating ways.</p>
<p>Or maybe the President raises the military budget. This would probably mean an expansion of existing military bases. Some of those are in Italy, and every time they expand the Italians nearby protest what the New York Times describes as "traffic congestion, environmental damage, and the possibility of terrorist attacks." So the President clearly wants terrorists to attack Italy.</p>
<p>So maybe the President just refuses to even touch the military budget at all. Well, in that case he's weak and passive and a bad leader, and probably no one will ever build a monument to him. And most monuments are built out of marble. And the best marble comes from Cararra in Italy. He must trying to sabotage the Italian marble industry!</p>
<p>(I mean, when the President makes one anti-Italian decision, you can kind of put your head in the sand and believe it might be a coincidence. But when all of his decisions hurt Italy in some way? Hardly!)</p>
<p>So the Principle of Anti-Charity is pretty hard to disprove. The reason I get so exasperated when anyone talks about gender is that the Principle of Anti-Charity seems to be the Official Standard For Debate. Here I will be quoting from The Uncredible Hallq, which is actually a really awesome blog with great analysis of some issues in philosophy of religion; despite me having a problem with this one minor thing I absolutely recommend it:</p> When you look at stuff like the reaction to Todd Aikin saying rape victims don’t need abortions because they won’t get pregnant if it’s a “legitimate rape,” what you see is people waking up to the fact that the anti-abortion movement isn’t about their public rhetoric about “partial birth abortion.” It’s full of vile extremists who want to deny women their basic right to bodily autonomy. I find this fascinating. Here is this one guy1 whom 99.999% of people on the anti-abortion side have condemned and tried to distance themselves from. Every single prominent Republican from Mitt Romney to Sean Hannity to John Ashcroft condemned him, which is almost unpredecented in terms of Republicans condemning fellow Republicans. The head of the RNC decided to ban him from the Republican Convention and called him "stupid". Republican Super PACs and the party itself stopped funding his race. Karl Rove publicly threatened to murder him - he sounded like he meant it figuratively, but since it's Karl Rove he should probably keep his doors bolted just in case.<p>A few people have said something like how they think he is a great guy personally and share his views about abortion even though that particular comment were idiotic, and a few people say they think the media reaction was disproportionate even though his comments were idiotic. One or two really fringe extremist pro-life groups have said they kind of agree with him although his way of putting it was idiotic. This is as close as anyone came to saying he wasn't an idiot.</p>
<p>And so of course we naturally conclude from this that he has spoken the secret heart of the anti-abortion movement and his opinions can be considered representative.</p>
<p>But more importantly, let's go to the last sentence of the quote: "It’s full of vile extremists who want to deny women their basic right to bodily autonomy."</p>
<p>They "want" to deny women their basic right to bodily autonomy in the same way that the President "wants" to destroy the livelihood of Italians. That is, they support a policy for completely different reasons and it will end out denying women their rights. If you would feel awkward saying the President is plotting to drown the Venetians, please feel exactly as awkward saying conservatives are plotting to deny women their right to bodily autonomy.</p>
<p>The same is true of the contraceptive mandate. Its Wikipedia article includes quotes like:</p> Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) said Republicans "want to take us back to the Dark Ages ... when women were property.""The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says, "House Republicans have launched an all-out war on women since taking the Speaker's gavel over a year ago." Right. It's obviously all about women. Because Republicans are usually so thrilled about government forcing them to do things against their religion. And they just love when Obama pushes through health care mandates.<p>The War On Women is exactly as real as the War On Christmas. People do not launch Wars On Applause Lights. People sometimes accuse their opponents of launching Wars on Applause Lights, because then instead of having to argue that a new hydroelectric dam is really necessary, they can just sit and watch while the President has to defends himself against hordes of angry Italian-American voters.</p>
<p>Speaking of Wars on Things, let's talk about the War on Terror. Everyone agrees terrorism is really bad. Some people want a Strong Response To Terror, which in practice consists of waterboarding some people and then bombing a randomly chosen Middle Eastern country. Other people want a More Measured Response To Terror, which in practice consists of trying to figure out what kind of things we do that make us a target for terrorism and then not doing them.</p>
<p>The former group of people call the latter group of people Soft On Terror. I think it's a terrible phrase, but it could be worse. They could accuse them of being part of "terrorism culture", an all-pervading belief system that terrorism is somewhere between excusable and admirable, and that every time they vote against a new drone bombing it is because they secretly think terrorists are great people. And every time they try to figure out the conditions that promote terrorism and decrease them, it's because of their deep-seated desire to blame the victims of terrorism for the attacks.</p>
<p>The point of this post is not for me to say either side is correct, or even that one side is not completely barking up the wrong tree and their so-called "solutions" are actually exactly the wrong way to go about it and will just make the terrorists stronger. Please do not try to infer my position in the actual debate just because I am talking about the meta-debate. If you have to know, I agree with the moderate liberal position on terrorism and I agree with the feminist position on the issue that this is an obvious metaphor for. But that doesn't matter.</p>
<p>What matters is that this is also a Principle of Anti-Charity issue. If you hear that some Democratic Senator voted not to invade Iraq, and your first thought is "I bet he secretly loves terrorists and thinks the victims of terrorism deserve what they get", then your head is not screwed on straight. </p>
<p>Suppose you hear Noam Chomsky say that maybe one way to decrease terrorist attacks would be to stop propping up the Saudi royal family. And maybe you know he's wrong and you have study after study showing that terrorists don't care about the Saudi royal family and that actually countries that support the Saudi royal family less are even more likely to be attacked by terrorists. But nevertheless if you decide that it's totally impossible that he's just a nice person who honestly wants to help - if you decide the only explanation for Chomsky's actions is that he's Osama bin Laden's best pal and secretly goes out to the cemetery every night to dance on the grave of 9-11 victims - if you use his advice as proof that our society is really a pro-al-Qaeda "terrorism culture" - then you have left the Way.</p>
<p>People do not launch Wars On Applause Lights. People do not Secretly Love Boo Lights. If you keep it up like this maybe I am seriously going to have to get that Principle of Charity tattoo.</p>
<p>FOOTNOTE: What the heck was Akin thinking, anyway? To anyone familiar with cognitive biases, the answer should be obvious. It's the just-world fallacy and the eternally springing hope that policy debates should be one-sided. Suppose you believed abortion was genuinely murder and just as bad as killing a grown adult. In that case, if women could get pregnant from rape, you would have to make an impossible moral choice between committing murder and forcing a woman to bear her rapist's child. It would be horrible and you would feel like a monster whichever you did. And the world is just and fair and never presents you with horrible impossible moral choices, therefore women cannot get pregnant from rape. So when he read a (terrible, unethical) doctor who claimed exactly that in a (terrible, unethical) article published in a real (terrible, unethical) book, he gave a big sigh of relief and didn't think twice about it.</p>

 Let's talk about the US missile defense shield.<p>Right now it can only shoot down a few missiles some of the time. But maybe one day it will be able to shoot down many missiles all of the time. The balance of power between the United States and Russia depends on mutually assured destruction. For either country to gain the ability to shoot down many missiles all of the time would upset this balance. Therefore, Russia opposes the US missile defense shield.</p>
<p>The United States tries to reassure Russia. "We're just building this shield to protect ourselves from Iran and North Korea", they say. This is super reasonable. The United States really does face a serious threat from Iran and North Korea. Building a missile defense shield is a great idea for reasons that have nothing to do with Russia. If Russia starts threatening to attack the United States if they don't stop building their shield, Russia looks like an aggressive jerk meddling in matters that don't concern it.</p>
<p>But say the United States finishes its defense shield, and then happens to disagree with Russia over some minor issue like the Syria conflict. "I think you better do what we say," says America. "We could crush you like a bug." And Russia says "But you told us your shield had nothing to do with us!". And the US answers "And we were telling the truth. We didn't intend it against you. But here we are, disagreeing with you and having a spare superweapon. It wasn't our original intent. But now, we own you."</p>
<p>Now let's talk about anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Suppose you were a Jew in old-timey Eastern Europe. The big news story is about a Jewish man who killed a Christian child. As far as you can tell the story is true. It's just disappointing that everyone who tells it is describing it as "A Jew killed a Christian kid today". You don't want to make a big deal over this, because no one is saying anything objectionable like "And so all Jews are evil". Besides you'd hate to inject identity politics into this obvious tragedy. It just sort of makes you uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The next day you hear that the local priest is giving a sermon on how the Jews killed Christ. This statement seems historically plausible, and it's part of the Christian religion, and no one is implying it says anything about the Jews today. You'd hate to be the guy who barges in and tries to tell the Christians what Biblical facts they can and can't include in their sermons just because they offend you. It would make you an annoying busybody. So again you just get uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The next day you hear people complain about the greedy Jewish bankers who are ruining the world economy. And really a disproportionate number of bankers are Jewish, and bankers really do seem to be the source of a lot of economic problems. It seems kind of pedantic to interrupt every conversation with "But also some bankers are Christian, or Muslim, and even though a disproportionate number of bankers are Jewish that doesn't mean the Jewish bankers are disproportionately active in ruining the world economy compared to their numbers." So again you stay uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Then the next day you hear people complain about Israeli atrocities in Palestine, which is of course terribly anachronistic if you're in old-timey Eastern Europe but let's roll with it. You understand that the Israelis really do commit some terrible acts. On the other hand, when people start talking about "Jewish atrocities" and "the need to protect Gentiles from Jewish rapacity" and "laws to stop all this horrible stuff the Jews are doing", you just feel worried, even though you personally are not doing any horrible stuff and maybe they even have good reasons for phrasing it that way.</p>
<p>Then the next day you get in a business dispute with your neighbor. If it's typical of the sort of thing that happened in this era, you loaned him some money and he doesn't feel like paying you back. He tells you you'd better just give up, admit he is in the right, and apologize to him - because if the conflict escalated everyone would take his side because he is a Christian and you are a Jew. And everyone knows that Jews victimize Christians and are basically child-murdering Christ-killing economy-ruining atrocity-committing scum.</p>
<p>He has a point - not about the scum, but about that everyone would take his side. Like the Russians in the missile defense example above, you have allowed your opponents to build a superweapon. Only this time it is a conceptual superweapon rather than a physical one. The superweapon is the memeplex in which Jews are always in the wrong. It's a set of pattern-matching templates, cliches, and applause lights.</p>
<p>The Eastern European Christians did not necessarily have evil intent in creating their superweapon, any more than the Americans had evil intent in their missile shield. No particular action of theirs was objectionable - they were genuinely worried about that one murder, they were genuinely worried about Israeli atrocities. But like the Americans, once they have that superweapon they can use it on anyone and so even if you are a good person you are screwed.</p>
<p>This rule of "never let anyone build a conceptual superweapon that might get used against you" seems to be the impetus behind a lot of social justice movements. For example, it's eye-rollingly annoying whenever the Council on American - Islamic Relations condemns a news report on the latest terrorist atrocity for making too big a deal that the terrorists were Islamic (what? this bombing just killed however many people, and all you can think of to get upset about is that the newspaper mentioned the guy screamed 'Allahu akbar' first?), but I interpret their actions as trying to prevent the construction of a conceptual superweapon against Islam (or possibly to dismantle one that already exists). Like the Jew whose best option would have been to attack potentially anti-Jewish statements even when they were reasonable in context, CAIR can't just trust that no one will use the anti-Muslim sentiment against non-threatening Muslims. As long as there are stupid little trivial disputes between Muslims and non-Muslims over anything at all, that giant anti-Muslim superweapon sitting in the corner is just too tempting to refuse.</p>
<p>This is also one reason (of at least three) why I have serious reservations about feminism.</p>
<p>Sometimes I read feminist blogs. A common experience is that by the end of the article I am enraged and want to make a snarky comment, so I re-read the essay to pick out the juiciest quotes to tear apart. I re-read it and I re-read it again and eventually I find that everything it says is both factually true and morally unobjectionable. They very rarely say anything silly like "And therefore all men, even the ones who aren't actively committing this offense I'm arguing against, are evil", and it's usually not even particularly implied. I feel like the Jew in the story above, who admits that it's really bad the Jewish guy killed the Christian child, and would hate to say, like a jerk, that Christians aren't allowed to talk about it.</p>
<p>But like him I am uncomfortable. Like him I can't shake the worry that they are building a conceptual superweapon that could be used against me.</p>
<p>Feminism is a memeplex that provides a bunch of pattern-matching opportunities where a man is in the wrong and a woman is in the right. To give a very personal example, I mentioned a few days ago how I was close friends with a woman until I asked her out and she then decided to have a fit and cut off all contact with me. Normally everyone would agree I was in the right and try to console me and maybe even her own friends would tell her she was overreacting. But thanks to feminism she has a superweapon - she can accuse me of being a Nice Guy (TM) and therefore Worse Than Hitler (TM). The appropriate cliche having been conveniently provided, enough people decide to round to the nearest cliche and decide that I am in the wrong that the incident raises her status and decreases my own.</p>
<p>And aside from my own experience I just keep seeing the superweapon turned on innocents. The awkward guy who asks a woman out in the wrong way, who to me is a figure of pity, gets superweaponed and turned into a figure of public vituperation. When a woman gives a guy a bunch of obvious hints and so he tries to kiss her or something and then gets yelled at and called a creep, he can't protest "I'm really sorry, but she was giving me a bunch of obvious hints" or else he will get superweaponed and everyone will pattern-match him to a rapist. And if anyone disagrees with the feminist position on any political issue, from free contraception to affirmative action, then even if they have reasonable philosophical arguments they get superweaponed and everyone completes the pattern as "misogynist". </p>
<p>Or in general, everyone agrees we need to do a certain number of things to deal with prejudice against women, but people generally disagree on exactly how far we should go, and if any two people disagree the one who supports less action risks superweaponing.</p>
<p>Also, whenever someone accuses feminists of being trigger-happy with their superweapon, they tend to turn their superweapon on the accuser. It creates kind of a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Now the feminists would say that I too have a superweapon called "patriarchy", and that they're just continuing the arms race. This is true, but it doesn't lead to a stable state like what the guns rights advocates claim would happen if everyone had guns where we would all be super-polite because nobody wants to offend a guy who's probably packing heat. It leads to something more like a postapocalyptic anarchy where everyone has guns and we're all shooting each other. If there's a conflict between a man and a woman, and the people involved happen to be old-fashioned patriarchalist types, then the man will automatically win and everyone will hate the woman for being a slut or a bitch or whatever. If there's a conflict between a man and a woman, and the people involved happen to be feminists who are familiar with the memeplex and all its pattern-matching suggests, then the woman will probably win and everyone will hate the man for being a creep or a bigot or whatever. At no point does everyone become respectful and say "Hey, we're all reasonable people with superweapons, let's judge this case on its merits instead of pattern-matching to the closest atrocity committed by someone of the same gender".</p>
<p>It also seems to me that the patriarchy is sort of an accident, where men ruled because they were big and strong and couldn't imagine doing otherwise and their values just sort of coalesced over time, and the struggle seems to be getting them to realize it's there. Whereas the feminists know all about discourse and power relations and so on and are quite gung ho about it and they're staying up late at night reading books with titles like How To Build A Much Deadlier Superweapon (I assume this book exists and is written by Nikola Tesla).</p>
<p>I'm all for mutual superweapon disarmament, but I'm not sure I like the whole mutually assured destruction thing as much. My history, and I think the history of a lot of people who are liberal and pro-choice and so on and so forth but really wary of feminism and social justice - is that we spent our college years totally supporting social justice and helping out in the superweapon factories because it's our duty to fight rape and racism and so on and since we were nice respectful people obviously the superweapon would never be used on us. Then we got in some kind of trivial disagreement with a woman or a minority or someone, or we didn't want to go far enough. Then they turned the superweapon on us, and it was kind of a moment of "wait, this was sort of the plan all along, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>I have an ambiguous respect for the white males who continue to be serious parts of the feminist and anti-racist movement - not just "well obviously I'm against discrimination but I'm not sure I'm drinking your Kool-Aid" people like myself, but the sort of who major in the appropriate college courses and write for the blogs and totally identify with the movement. It's ambiguous because I'm not sure if they're really naive ("Oh, they would never use this superweapon unless they had a really really good reason, and certainly not on the nice people like me") or whether they are really selfless ("I know this superweapon will eventually be used against me and other innocent people, but it's so important to arm this group against real enemies that I will help them build it anyway for purely consequentialist reasons.")</p>
<p>But I myself am not going there. The United States has mostly reassured Russia by promising them that their missile shield will be able to deflect the few and weak Korean/Iranian missiles it might face, but not the more numerous and more advanced Russian varieties. I think it's probably possible to create forms of social justice that would actually be focused against real threats and not provide free superweapons to anyone who wants to vaporize a few unattractive nerds before dinner. I just don't think the community in its current form is very good at pursuing them.</p>

I'm getting quite impressed with your courage at writing this.And although this is a public post and therefore presumably free to share, this is starting to sound so private that I feel obliged to ask whether it's okay for me to link this to all those 1000+ people who supposedly follow me on G+ and/or FB. I would suggest editing the "people like you" paragraph a little, though - it started sounding like you were claiming that your reader would fit every detail of the description you gave, which was a little distracting for someone who wouldn't agree with such a characterization of himself.(Also, you saying that the kind of propose-on-the-first-day reaction has actually been shown to produce good results makes me a little more annoyed at myself. There's been one time in my life when overhearing somebody's conversation in a café table made me so convinced of her being a potentially good match that I actually walked up to her and asked her out. She politely let me know that she was already taken, but that she was very flattered that I asked. Ever since that, I've been kicking myself for not giving her my card and inviting her to get in touch in case she wanted to be just friends. Because if she was anywhere as cool as I thought, being just friends with her would've been totally awesome as well, and now you're telling me that my intuition was possibly right in that regard. Ah well. :)
I actually don't think this one is too dangerous and I give you permission to share it, but yes, in general please don't share posts of mine on controversial topics like race or gender that might get me in trouble. Also, if you share on facebook, could you turn off the option ("Show Preview") that makes it post my photo along with the post? It kind of weirds me out.Yeah, sorry about the "people like you" paragraph. I occasionally try to copy the style of ("channel") interesting writers and I was trying to see if I could pull off a Last Psychiatrist. Obviously I can't yet.Also, I don't think I said that the propose-on-the-first-day reaction has been shown to produce good results, unless you mean the LBJ anecdote which is interesting because of how totally atypical it is.
Hmm. This post was interesting, but confusing; I don't think the sort of 'True Love' behavior you describe is wrong or necessarily creepy at all. It may be stupid, for example a case of love at first sight and eventually when the two people get to know each other they find they're not compatible at all. But that doesn't make it creepy.What does seem wrong and creepy and scary is when someone expresses True Love, is informed that it is not reciprocated, and keeps on trying. I can understand that the desperation you describe would find it difficult to accept 'no' for an answer. I can understand that if LBJ had taken 'no' for an answer Lady Bird might never have had her idyllic marriage. But it is still really creepy.My True Objection is an aesthetic appreciation for fiery dazzling love and a sense of crushing ugliness with the modern culture of "Let's meet for coffee sometime, or not, meh, plenty of fish in the sea, so whatever."You have, once again, hit close. This is pretty much exactly how the arranged marriage scene works, and why I dislike it. And yet most arranged marriages seem to work very well, so perhaps there's something to be said for the modern culture.

Your two paragraphs starting "I know that True Love is really inconvenient" seems in direct contradiction to your conclusion about "an aesthetic appreciation for the fiery dazzling love that comes out of nowhere". If you feel both preferences strongly at once, then you surely understand the people who feel only one of them. The people who only feel True Love, and the people who are only creeped out by it, are precisely the two kinds who can't get along well. In modern culture, it's being pointed out that e.g. geek men are mostly pro TL, and geek women are mostly against it.

Heavens am I glad that someone finally wrote about this.According to the Official Narrative, True Love is called infatuation, puppy love, or being in love with the idea of someone. Once you do get in a relationship with your Truly Beloved, you get disappointed for several reasons: you get on the hedonistic treadmill, you lose the thrill of chasing someone, and you discover sides of your Truly Beloved you dislike. Therefore, True Love fades quickly, in about six months. This makes it fake and immature, unlike the kind of love that blossoms well into a relationship.There are many counterexamples, such as the anecdote you quote, or Louis Aragon and Elsa Triolet. But this fading is referenced often enough in literature that it's probably real."Maybe if anyone were allowed to show True Love, everyone would fake it and there would be an arms race or something?": Have you ever read 17th-century love letters? Our "Let's meet for coffee" is their "I writhe in the flames of the most ardent Love, and if you will not release me from my torment, my despair will leave me no recourse but death". I think they were commonly understood to be hyperbolic, especially the suicide threats.
Hm.I wonder about this. It seems like the thing about Twoo Wuv - I speak from perhaps a bit of experience (I spent hours speaking to the woman who became my wife the first day we met, and there was no one else for me from that day on) - is that there is a specific place where it becomes creepiness, and it's okay up to that point. And it really should not be that hard to tell when that place is.It's when she tells you to go the f--k away. Not flirt, not coquettishly feeling amused or flattered and unsure how she's going to react in the long term, not taking time to make up her mind. All that still gives social cues that it's okay to do what you're doing. (One of the points that people are trying to make is also to her - that if she doesn't want what you're doing, she should quit being socialized not to tell you to stop.)Infatuation is great - nothing wrong with it. But infatuation isn't falling in love with a person. It's falling in love with your idea of another person, because you don't actually know the other person yet.Without that feeling the species wouldn't propagate. But for it to become a real relationship, the initial infatuation always has to give way to actual knowledge of and evaluation of the other person as a human being. And foremost in that knowledge has to be the understanding of what that person thinks of you - whether they want to continue being associated with you. And if you don't get communication that she wants to continue to be associated with you, then the infatuation has become only about what you want and not what she wants, despite now knowing what she wants, and sorry, that's not acceptable.My wife-to-be and I spoke for hours almost every night, running up absurd phone bills. But from very early on we were doing equivalent amounts of calling to each other.So yes, initial infatuation is great. And continual pursuit while getting conflicting or undecided or ambiguous signals is not creepy. It's when she says go away and you don't - well, explain the sort of love that does not involve respecting or caring about what the person you love wants...Edited at 2012-09-15 02:26 pm (UTC)
Actually the PUA and the feminist have a deep commonality that lies beneath this one: the lens they view everything through is power relations,.Power relations and True Love are not like oil and water. Much more like matter and anti-matter.
Thank you for writing this. It's the first new thing I've seen on the subject, and plausible as well.(Actually, there's something in Brave New World that runs parallel about people in that world having more but much less intense passions so that society will run more smoothly. However, that quote doesn't seem to be part of current discussions.)Possibly there's a case for research. Even if a lot of it has to be based on asking people what they remember, maybe there are some clues about the difference between assertive courtships which are unreciprocated in the early phases that lead to good relationships and those which are early signs of abuse. 
For some reason it took me this long to realize that if the genders were reversed between me and Mike, I would have been fucked.Damn.
I think this is true for most nerd girls in het relationships. 
Note to author: I googled the quote and I cannot find a match. Maybe someone deleted the comment?In my paranoia, I wonder if it's someone I know talking about me. O.OIt would certainly fit, not perfectly, but spookily well in one of the details.**Please provide source thread, author.**#On another note, I think a great question to ask someone in True Love is:Are you getting laid occasionally?And suspect that 90% of the time the answer to that question will be 'no'.Edited at 2012-09-15 04:46 pm (UTC)

"Are you getting laid occasionally?"When in True Love:- I did not want to get laid, and thus didn't.- I did not want to lay anyone except my True Love, and found that staying in True Love was much more valuable than changing this preference.- I got laid, with my True Love, and it was absolutely amazing.- I got laid, with people other than my True Love, and it was boring but took care of physical urges.When not in True Love:- I did not want to get laid, and thus didn't.- I got laid, and it was boring but took care of physical urges.- I got laid, with people I kinda liked and could see myself dating, and it was boring and diminished my romantic interest, though it was an okay bonding activity as friends.There is something to be said for "The best way to get over someone is to get under someone", but in my experience it works mostly to make you feel like romance and sex are absolutely gross. Kind of like chewing and spitting out chocolate to stop craving it.

I think this one says more about your personal experience with courtship than it does about the experience of courtship in general. In particular, you are ascribing a level of self-awareness to the general populace which they simply don't have.A recurring theme in this post is the conflation of desperation with enthusiasm. Women don't have a policy of rejecting men who show strong feelings for them. They're weirded out by men who show disproportionately stronger feelings for them than they can reciprocate, and for good reason. Desperation isn't just unsexy, it's kind of threatening.Compare and contrast these two gambits:"So would you like to get together tomorrow? Or Wednesday or Thursday? I'm pretty much free all week, actually, so whenever's good for you..."and"I'm supposed to be going out tomorrow with some work buddies, but I'd much rather talk some more with you about [whatever we've just been talking about] than talk shop with them. Do you fancy getting a drink?"The latter is saying "I am at least this interested in you; are you at least this interested in me?" Our protagonist may very well be prepared to take a swim in a skip full of broken glass to spend time with the woman in question, but he has no idea whether she is as enthusiastic, so he makes a bid which is low on an absolute scale but high on a relative one. If she's cancel-drinks-with-work-buddies interested, but not swim-in-broken-glass interested, she's not going to be scared off.The former, on the other hand, is saying "I am unconditionally interested in you; are you unconditionally interested in me?" If she is unconditionally interested in him, she won't reject him because of some policy she has. If she's not unconditionally interested in him (which, let's face it, she probably isn't), she's going to think "woah, that's a disproportionate amount of interest. He seems pretty desperate, and there's a whole bunch of reasons I shouldn't spend time with desperate guys".Chances are that you don't know exactly how keen the object of your affections is. When you are extremely interested in someone, understating that interest isn't a Machiavellian lie, it's a simple point of pragmatism.

And poor people like me who really do happen to be free all week, and don't realize they're apparently supposed to lie about this (?!), will get labelled creeps despite not feeling or intending to demonstrate unusually high interest.

Yep, you're a fellow sufferer from limerence (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerence). (Even after accounting for the Forer effect (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forer_effect), it explains the aspects of my own romantic experience that a lot of other people Just Don't Get, like the vivid romantic-but-not-even-sexual imaginative episodes.)A couple things I've learned:There's an extremely rare and specific type of woman who'll trigger a limerent episode, including conditions like "sees the world primarily through an aesthetic prism rather than a practical or logical one". This only became clear around the time of my fourth or fifth limerent experience, when I saw that there were far too many coincidences for chance alone to explain.When my gut tells me that a girl I've met meets that type, I immediately feel it coming on, and within a few hours I'm utterly head over heels.I will never develop feelings like those for a girl who's not that type, regardless of how awesome she is in other ways or how long we date.So far, this feeling has never vanished completely, though I don't think about girls with whom I no longer interact; the women for whom I've been struck with limerence occupy different cognitive categories from every other friend or ex, even years afterwards, and they still have a power over me that nobody else has.My brain has internalized that limerence is something that happens within me, rather than Fate revealing itself. This internalization required not just a materialist outlook on life, but traumatic experiences of (a) a mutually limerent relationship that was a complete disaster due to basic psychological incompatibility (and despite having draining relationship crises every two weeks, we were set on marrying... until we went long-distance and she fell in love with someone else) and (b) having unrequited limerence for a girl who I met, dated and scared off (though without being regarded as creepy, so far as I can tell), who then took to happily dating another good friend, and despite my best efforts to soldier on, this consumed me for three years even as I went through several other relationships of my own. Thank goodness I eventually moved away and had another limerent experience.It is really difficult to have a relationship with someone I'm not limerent towards, because there's an Elephant In The Room that prevents me from opening up emotionally without completely devastating her.So, um, yeah. This is the part where I should offer advice on how to handle it. And I would, if I had any; unfortunately, I've not yet found my way to limerent happiness (a stable relationship with someone I'm in love with, who loves me back (either limerently or in a way that's OK with my limerence), and such that we're actually happy together and good for each other), though I'm in better shape than I was years ago.(Not going to de-anonymize this time. From my style, you can perhaps figure out who this is; I'd just rather the essence of my romantic life not be easily searchable.)

Limerence describes the way my romantic attachments formed into my mid-twenties. My late twenties saw some fairly radical changes in the way I thought about relationships and attraction. For the past several years I have not experienced limerence at all. Though there are still special types of people who I am especially and powerfully attracted to, they don't incite the limerent response in me.I can't say how strongly it's related, because there are a lot of confounding variables, but my contemporary non-limerent attractions appear a lot healthier and easier to manage than those I experienced when I was younger. They also tend to "pay off" more frequently.I'm not suggesting this is generally the case, but I am curious as to how you would feel if you were matter-of-factly told that one day you would grow out of limerent attraction. Would you consider it a loss?
Burning Life-Consuming Crushes - good phrase for it. Been there, done that, driven a few women up the wall. I probably would've made a marriage proposal if I'd gotten far enough with one.* I tend to doubt that we would've wound up as happy as LBJ^2 did. Finally I found a true partner in my 30s and we've been together for 15 years now. But I had a lot of growing up to do before I made a decent partner for her.As for why Declarations of True Love are discouraged in our culture today, I think it's because of the change in life priorities. Marriage and kids are supposed to come later, once both partners have established themselves as economically productive members of society. If you let them fall passionately in love with each they'll duck out of work early to go canoodle and then one will quit the job to raise the babies. One night stands are more compatible with grad school / founding a start-up / climbing the executive ladder.Back in LBJ's day a guy didn't look responsible enough to be promotable until he was married with a kid on the way. Now managers want someone with no life outside work. (I now look at the landmine of how this ties in with the changing role of women in the workplace and leave stepping on it to someone else)* Well, there was a marriage proposal to one crush, but it was more in the category of I'm-giving-you-one-more-reason-to-get-out-of-my-house-right-now than actually trying to have a relationship.
True Love is regarded as much as an enemy as it was in the days of arranged marriages -- as a way to derail you from the true purpose of our lives.Which is, apparently, making money.
It's possible that this is a case of "you can't optimize for everything".Also, it's plausible that disallowing early unreciprocated enthusiasm in courtship leads to an increased chance of unenthusiastic relationships, but how would you find out?

Might your Arabic poet be Hafez? Quoth Wikipedia, which is always right except when it's wrong, "According to one tradition, Hafez had been working in a bakery [...] There he first saw Shakh-e Nabat, a woman of great beauty, to whom some of his poems are addressed. Rabished by her beauty, but knowing that his love for her would not be requited, he allegedly held his first mystic vigil in his desire to realize this union. [...] his further attempts at union became mystic; a pursuit of spiritual union with the divine. A Western parallel is that of Dante and Beatrice." Nothing about camels, though.
Yeah, I saw that last night when I was trying to Google, but it doesn't fit with the story I heard. If it helps, I have a vague memory he might have been from Islamic Spain.
I know the politically-correct get pissed at me for doing things like this - intersectionality and all that - but: assuming you're het - imagine someone falling in True Love with you whom you could not love in return, but who was physically imposing enough to be threatening. Imagine there was a man, built like a football player, who got as obsessed with you as you describe being obsessed. And pursued you. And wouldn't leave you alone because he was sure you were Meant To Be Together.Of course there's nothing wrong with him just constructing these elaborate fantasies about you and him. Plastering pictures of you up around his room. Delivering flowers. And not leaving you alone.Maybe that doesn't bother you. It bothers me. I resolved a long time ago never to be that guy, regardless of how attractive I found a woman who didn't know me.
Oh, obviously. That's why I'm saying I can totally see why it seems reasonable to get rid of it. And I agree with your previous post that there are degrees from "flattered but not interested right now" to "seriously, fuck off". But Supervillain test again. If the solution to a problem is totally eliminating love from the world, maybe we need a better solution or more tolerance for a problem.

Your item (1) says there is data supporting the claim "A sudden intuitive obsession with another person as a romantic partner ("True Love") is often accurate".This claim does not match my intuition, so I'd be interested in knowing more about the data. Who performed a study measuring the percent of true-love events that proved accurate, and how did they tune the study to make sure that people accurately reported the number of negative events they'd experienced?
As far as I know there is no specific data about love (though trying to collect it would be fascinating.) I do know there is data elsewhere that first impressions are generally accurate - Blink is a good if pop-sciencey collection thereof. One experiment from there I particularly remember is that if you see a five-second clip of a teacher teaching, you are just as accurate evaluating their competence as you are if you watch them for several whole lessons (I don't remember the endpoint; either they found that both correlated highly with each other, or that both correlated highly with objective measures like test scores).
Can we distinguish between "loved her so much he went off to write a lifetime of poems about her beauty" and "thought this effort created an obligation in her" ? Because I would find someone composing a billion poems about me weird and concerning enough to watch if I interacted with them regularly, but not rapey. Rapey would be "how could you go out with that guy, he hasn't written you any poems at all?"It's tricky because people hate disharmonies like unrequited True Love, and women in particular are more likely to be socialized to feel it creates an obligation. So a woman can feel pressured to reciprocate even if the man is truly happy sitting at home thinking of new rhymes for her name, but men can also (consciously or not) apply a lot of pressure without doing anything overt.
Sure, I agree that's a useful distinction.As far as I remember the story, which obviously is not very far, al-Fulani didn't know her name, never tried to seek her out, and mostly just wrote poems to "that one pretty girl I met at the oasis that one time". This seems eccentric but harmless.Edited at 2012-09-15 08:07 pm (UTC)
I suspect a lot of romantic attraction comes down to smell; there's some evidence that smell signals immunocompatiblity, which should be more or less symmetric. This may explain some intense mutual attractions that become stable long-term relationships.
From: (Anonymous)2012-09-15 08:35 pm (UTC) (Link)
See my long comment above on limerence. Unless immunocompatibility correlates with things like "aesthetically based philosophical worldview", I don't think it's a very good explanation for my experience.
I found (and quite enjoyed) this series of meditations after trying to convey some similar sentiments (http://lesswrong.com/lw/efs/call_for_anonymous_narratives_by_lw_women_and/7fx0?context=1#comments) in the LW thread. (See also here (http://lesswrong.com/lw/efs/call_for_anonymous_narratives_by_lw_women_and/7eeo).) I am actually fairly satisfied with my interaction with the OP from the post you quoted, but you might notice that there is another person with whom my conversation was not as productive. Since it seems to me that we are generally expressing the same ideas* (although you are doing a much more thorough and eloquent job), perhaps you might have better luck explaining things to this person (whom you know much better than I do). At this point, I've pretty much exhausted the energy I stored up for my ~yearly foray into gender issues.*Of course, if you don't think we're expressing the same ideas, feel free to ignore or correct me.Edited at 2012-09-15 10:15 pm (UTC)
This is necessarily coloured by personal experience, and your personal experience isn't necessarily the same as mine. I've had all-consuming loves, but I've also had a love or two that developed slowly.My perspective is that all-consuming loves are not about the person that one loves, but rather about oneself -- they are necessarily about one's projection of one's wishes and desires onto the other person, rather than about who they really might be. When they pan out, it's because the other person coincidentally had interesting depths of their own.These depths are equally discoverable in a love that develops at a more measured pace.I think overwhelming crushes are in disrepute because being put on a surprise pedestal can be annoying -- individually, we know that we are not gods, so it is odd to hear a stranger insist that we are.
"I know that True Love is really inconvenient"I have the poet for you:"It doesn't make no sense no. It's not convenient no. It doesn't fit my plans no. It's something I don't understand."

I think what is bothering me about this post is the following lines:he started calling her and writing letters to her practically nonstop; ten weeks later she finally agreedcertain amounts of pestering and wooing and opinion-changing were necessaryWhen I read these lines I think of two separate statements:Statement #1: "If you feel True Love for someone, but e doesn't like you, it should be totally okay to try persistently to persuade hir to like you."Statement #2: "If you feel True Love for someone and e does like you, it should be totally okay to try persistently to persuade hir to marry you, even if you haven't been dating for very long."I think you will agree with me that Statement #1 is horrible and toxic and extremely dangerous. I have a friend who tried acting on Statement #1, with another friend, and eight years later the two of them still cannot be in the same room together.I have less strong feelings about Statement #2 because it has not wrecked any social groups in my personal experience. But the more I think about it, the less I like it. When people are making important life decisions, they should be given space and allowed to gather data; they should not feel pressured.The rest of your essay doesn't seem to be about Statement #1 or Statement #2; it's about what a shame it is that there's a stigma for saying I Love You too early. That seems like a reasonable sentiment. But the examples you're using to support it seem to be examples of really bad human behavior.
Your other commenters have touched on this in the past, but I think you're continuing to conflate Nice Guy(TM)ness with "Firthing".Nice Guyness is more along the lines of hazarding an opinion on a woman's preferences regarding sexual receptivity – coregulating is really the operative word – particularly when you're an interested party. It also touches on this dynamic: http://xkcd.com/513/ – where your pleasantness is motivated, consciously or unconsciously, by an unspoken hope or expectation (hard to tease those two apart) of sexual favorability. And that might seem benign, but the ugly side of it generally involves bitterness – or a signaled risk of bitterness – at defied expectations, even by those who thought their motivations were entirely positive.It's a prominent theme, because it's something a lot of geeky guys do, my younger self included. The creepiness isn't just a squick-thing, it's a lingering threat by people who seem or "are" nice, but don't have enough self-awareness about their motivations or what they are capable of. Motivated reasoning makes the worst behavior seem justified. Genuine kindness and moral innocence borne atop of a marked lack of self-awareness is a trap. That's the creepiness.Edited at 2012-09-17 12:16 am (UTC)
I don't think I'm conflating Nice Guys (TM) with anything. I think it's intended as an inherently fuzzy concept so that people can equivocate it when needed - give a definition of it that makes it look bad when trying to convince people it's a bad thing, then use a much looser definition when you're trying to accuse someone of fitting the template.As for worrying that my liking someone might be sexually motivated - well, of course. But what's the alternative? You see a girl, you think she's really pretty, and she's also really awesome and would make a good friend. You can either never befriend her because you think your motives might not be pure and so it would be Dishonest - and I spent ten years or so doing exactly that - or you can just say "screw it" and become friends with her.It's my job not to be a jerk to her if she rejects me. It is not my job to deal with completely counterfactual circumstances in which she might pattern-matches me to someone who might be a jerk to her if she rejected them and so never talk to or approach or befriend women.
Once upon a time, I met a girl at a bus stop. (You needed to take buses to get around to different parts of my college campus.) We started talking. Not too long after, the following dialogue occurred:Me: What's your favorite Final Fantasy?Her: Six.Me: Will you marry me?Yes, I was kidding, but I really did have exactly that reaction that the commenter you mentioned was wary of. Further interaction with her basically confirmed that she was indeed totally awesome, but she had just started up a relationship with someone else at the time. I haven't seen her in ages...</div></div><hr><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" /></head>Page URL: http://squid314.livejournal.com/328528.htmlTitle: Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz - The Fourth Meditation On Creepiness</br>Author: Unknown</br><div><div>
Comments:
The problem is that most people do the actual communication through non-verbal communication, and backing off if the other person doesn't respond.Give someone a hand up, and if their hand lingers for longer than it needs to, then that indicates* that they like touching you. Rub their back, and if they keep arching into it, then that's a positive sign. If you're cuddling with your arm around them, and they snuggle into you so that your arm is over their breasts, another positive sign. Put your arm a little too close to their breasts and they wriggle around so it's not there, and that's a negative sign.All little "points" up and down a scale, and for people who are good at reading those signs, it all adds up fairly easily and smoothly. People who are _rubbish_ at reading those signs tend to have discontinuous jumps rather than smoother curves - collecting tokens of "You are now allowed to do X" that make things entirely explicit.And that's safer sometimes, and totally worth it if you're not sure. But I don't think it's how most people manage this stuff.*That's "indicates", not "100% proves", obviously.
I understand what you're saying, but "rub the person's back to find out if they like you" totally contradicts the "ask consent before touching" rule. I suppose you can ask "May I rub your back", but again that's textbook creepy.So I agree that what you say are the unwritten rules. What I'm saying is that they contradict the written rules and so whichever set you choose you can get demonized for not following the other.
Damn, I'd been hoping that the narrower definition of Nice Guy was in play-- that it was specifically about the man who listens to a woman's complaints about inferior boyfriends, never makes a move towards a romantic/sexual relationship, and then resents her for it.Instead, it seems that there are at least some women who use a wider definition.*****There's another strategy some people use-- asking mutual friends about the possibility of romantic interest.

How are the mutual friends supposed to know? If friend X asks me about mutual friend Y's possible interest in her, and I hadn't happened to talk to Y about it before, I'd have no idea. Is the idea for the mutual friends to gather hints that the actual target of the hints doesn't get?
&gt; So instead you lead up with a question that seems innocuous to an American who's not thinking about spying, but to a Soviet who is specifically looking for another spy is sorta kinda suggestive of Russia. The other spy can't just say "Ah, I understand your code, I too am a spy" because then he might blow his cover to an American who was just looking for some good borscht. So he says something that slightly escalates the Russianness. You can't just blow your cover now, because you're still not sure he's not just an American who appreciates a good plate of borscht himself, so you escalate the Russianness slightly further. In other words, you start off with a conversation that could happen by coincidence, decrease the chance of coincidence a little bit at each exchange only once you get the signal from the other, and eventually the conversation becomes one that couldn't possibly happen by coincidence and you know he's the other spy.Fantastic. Now I can't stop thinking about innuendo as &gt;1 likelihood ratios...

What? I wasn't saying anything like "you shouldn't ask out total strangers." I was saying that you should avoid propositioning total strangers for sex where it's likely to frighten them (and even frighten you if you were in their position). I see little problem with asking out strangers for a date where it's socially acceptable, or propositioning people for sex in places where such propositions are socially acceptable (bars and clubs for example), or trying to turn friends into more than friends.&gt;I can not get to know her and immediately ask for a date while we are still strangers. This makes me a Creep.Only if you're absolutely awful in social situations and haven't an ounce of charm, then yeah they'll call you a creep (though you're not) because of how awkward you are (and how rude they are). All you need to do is start a short conversation, see if they're enjoying it, then end the conversation with a "hey, if you're not seeing anyone, we should get a coffee some time." They can always just say "sorry, I'm seeing someone."I think you need a better model of social norms for dating, flirting, and propositioning. And I think you might have mixed up "let's go for coffee" (i.e., a euphemism for "let's go on a date") with "want to come up to my room for a coffee" (i.e., a euphemism for "let's have sex").Edited at 2012-09-13 11:09 pm (UTC)
Sorry for misinterpreting you. Looking at it again your point was definitely that all three factors coincide. I do think you were saying that strangeness is at least a risk factor, though.
"not only are there two ladders, but that women can't even conceive of the idea of having a single ladder where liking someone and wanting to date them are correlated"Not true. Multiple women I know date and/or are married to guys who started out as best friends. The key word here is "best". You don't get to switch ladders except at the top or bottom. Your mistake was trying to switch near the middle, when the cost of losing you was still low enough."I guess a fourth possibility is that there is a certain window in which it is acceptable to ask women out in which you are neither quite a stranger nor quite their friend. If this is true, please for the love of Truth and Beauty just tell me what this window is. "When you are a vouched acquaintance. This is like being a certified used car. Be a friend of a friend or a friend's boyfriend or belong to the same club/church or share similar opinions online.Also, it helps to ask in a really non-threatening way. I. e. if you go out to do date-type stuff (whatever that is for you) as friends, and stay together in the same space as friends, and eventually you just happen to be found, all cute and available somewhere close at hand then sex will very likely happen, because women like sex. And then you can keep on having sex, as friends, or get married, or get a dog together, or even start calling each other Soulmates Forever. What I'm saying here is that your experience with Alice is not unusual. It's pretty normal. It's how many women think things are supposed to be. To figure out whether it's ok to go from cuddling to breast-holding try kissing something innocuous. It's just like asking, but not creepy.Seriously, there is far less demonization out there than you might think."once it becomes too complicated it becomes impossible for well-intentioned people to follow"Yes. That's because "well-intentioned" is not the only criterion by which women pick sexual partners. Being able and willing to do a complicated mating dance is a signal of serious intentions and respect.
I don't mind if women want to only go out with people who can do a complicated mating dance. That's their right.But if they deliberately make the mating dance super complicated and then freak out when anyone misses a step and call the guy a creep and a potential rapist and try to ruin his reputation, that's kind of, well, mean?
For a female perspective, I *have* had the whole business about "Man, I thought he liked me as a person and enjoyed spending time with me. But then he said he wanted to date me! What a dirty rotten liar!"First time I ever went on a date, in fact. I was young and naive. I met a guy at a party and we clicked over our interest in economics and libertarianism. He told me I was smart and interesting. He asked me out...and then I noticed him leaning in like he was going to kiss me and I thought "Oh god he LIED about thinking I was smart and interesting! It was just a ruse to get into my pants! He's probably laughing about me with all his friends!" I panicked and didn't speak to him again for two years.Well, Sadie Lou has moved on from that level of cluelessness, but I still sometimes have the thought "Drat, I hope he's not into me *that* way, I really want to collaborate with him/go into business with him/talk about ideas with him." Sometimes you want the non-sexual connection to be genuine. 
Huh. As someone who's specifically attracted to intelligent women, and who has mild demisexual tendencies and thus needs that non-sexual connection for a proper sexual connection to form in the first place... I find it quite scary to hear that a meme saying that "if they ask me out, then they don't actually like me as a person" exists and is apparently at least somewhat common.(Also, the topic under discussion makes me uncomfortably conscious of the fact that in three out of four of posts so far, I've replied to your comment in particular, and that this might be taken as creepy or Internet-stalking or something. Um. No creepiness intended.)

this all sounds terrible for the following reason.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTomKxvEVz0&amp;feature=player_embedded
I think you would appreciate this sequence: www.sandraandwoo.com/2011/10/20/0318-landon-is-not-aware-of-the-ladder-theory/www.sandraandwoo.com/2011/10/24/0319-larisa-is-not-aware-of-the-ladder-theory/
The Universe needs to be much more like comics.
Okay, here is how this is done in Russia.The guy cannot (under any circumstances, unless he is hiring a prostitute on the street) ask out a girl he just encountered, under the pains and penalties of her thinking he believes her to be a prostitute, which makes him a creep even if she is one. Step 1. He has to come up with a socially acceptable reason to start a conversation, out of which people usually go with directions (could you please tell me how to get to the museum, thank you, btw, if you know, would your fine arts be a good choice for a fan of medieval paintings, what do you guys have (I'm new to town), do you enjoy them too, great, well, may I possibly interest you in meeting later today for the exhibit of Fra Angelico that was highly recommended to me by a friend who teaches at Moscow State, etc - and in course of the conversation it is damn obvious whether she is helping you or not. If she is interested in you, she will like the painting, and come with you and allow you to carry on with the first step). Obviously, the idea is that you look at the girl and determine whether you should be asking about a museum or a coffee shop, or maybe a ice cream stand. If she is not interested, she will just tell you she is busy today. If she is in fact really busy-but-would-come she will suggest a different date and time herself, and may even leave contact information.Step 2: you go to the exhibition/cinema/museum/coffee shop, meet there, and talk, exchanging biographies, in course of which you find out if the girl has any pending engagements. If she is not immediately interested, she will tell about her boyfriend, or lie about a boyfriend, or just tell you that she is not interested and whether\how she is engaged - whereupon you bluntly tell her that you would like to remain friends especially given the common interest, she says ok, and you remain friends, until step 4.Step 3: if she is not presently engaged, you can ask her for another meeting of the similar nature, and if she is interested, she will agree to another meeting, after which you take her out for a meal, and there you can ask her if she is interested in dating you socially, i.e. going out to events together and such. If she says yes, you pick up the bill. Then you can hold hands, lock arms, you can kiss at parting, and eventually progress as far as you both feel comfortable, and she will not freak out if you eventually suggest sex. She may say no, or not yet, but she will not think you creep. If she says no, you immediately suggest that you will be happy to remain her friend if that is the case, and proceed to step 4.Step 4: you are acquainted with each other for some time, you get to know about each other to a certain degree, and at some point you get privy to her affairs. If she is with someone, and it does not look promising, and you were actually looking for a girlfriend, you just back off and hit on someone else. Which does not exclude remaining friends with her. If turns out she is available after all, and will let you know by telling you that she has broken up with a boyfriend or current engagement, at which point you have to find out if that involves painful memories, or such, and if she's past that thing, you proceed to step three. If it is a painful thing and she is all over the last relationship, you get her drunk and crying, tell her how she's awesome and you like her and the other guy is a jerk, and you would ask her on a whim if she were up for it, but do not attempt anything physical. Whereupon she throws herself in your arms and mission accomplished, or she thanks you for being a great friend and really understanding, and you proceed to step 2.
Oh my.Sometimes I wondered if dating is simpler in Russia (I haven't been there since I was, like, 14). I guess I would have even worse time there.
I may be jumping off the feminist bandwagon here, but I think people (incidentally, mostly women) who react badly to reasonable requests like "Would you like to go out?" or "May I touch your breasts?" (I've pulled both of those, and it wasn't creepy in context) are either insecure, self-aggrandizing, or assholes (with some exceptions who honestly perceive something that shouldn't be creepy as creepy due to past experience).The border between creepy and not lies in context; you don't ask the first one of someone you haven't met yet or haven't interacted with in a personal setting (there is no window; your female friend is a jerk), and you don't ask the second of someone you aren't physically comfortable with (outside of very particular settings with different social conventions).As was said frequently by my former roommate, "I love my social circle." It turns out that there are people whom you can just ask "Hey, would you like to have sex?" and they respond with "Not really, but I appreciate the offer," and you go on being friends.I find it interesting to observe that in a kinky setting or subculture asking things like that isn't creepy and is kind of expected, unless you come off as pressuring or whining.

Looking at the replies (and using my own intuition), I think that Rule 1 was simply the wrong abstraction to take from Elevator-gate. The following might be a better one:It's usually creepy to jump to (or request, overtly or tacitly) a *much* higher level of intimacy than your current baseline with someone. Or, to put it the other way around, the social norm is to escalate in small stages with reciprocity (like the exchange between spies), maintaining plausible deniability so that either party can back out while saving face.This encompasses the creepiness of the elevator proposal: going from "complete stranger" to "propositioning for sex" violates the rule. It also explains why you're supposed to try out (while being careful to look for reciprocity) intermediate nonverbal stages toward a romantic physical act (like the more intimate kinds of cuddling) rather than ask overtly for it when in a non-romantic analogue.There are all sorts of nuance, of course; people's level-of-assumed-intimacy baseline for strangers will be significantly higher in some contexts (dance clubs, for instance) than in others (bus stops, for instance). And because of all the layers of signaling and countersignaling, it's possible for some people sometimes to break this rule without being seen as creepy (especially if they're known to be high-status). But it's a much more plausible heuristic for our social norms than "don't make romantic advances toward strangers, ever".And here's a (flattering, sorry) personal example: Once, my flatmate was having a friend stay over on the apartment couch, and she and I immediately hit it off. I didn't spend my time consciously strategizing during our conversation, but every time she made a move to sit closer to me, I did the same (the next time I shifted posture). Eventually, my flatmate went to bed... and instead of directly making a move, I suggested taking a walk, she came along, and on the walk I kissed her. This was a Very Good way of going about it un-creepily, for two reasons: first, it allowed me to check my instincts by seeing if she'd say yes to an invitation that was semi-romantic, and secondly, if I'd made my first overtly romantic move right next to where she'd be sleeping, it would seem to be a tacit request for a lot more (thus violating the rule).(Yeah, there *are* invisible rules like that one about sleeping area. But if you escalate in small steps, you're less likely to wreak too much havoc even if you break one of those.)The "Nice Guy = Worse Than Hitler" is its own can of worms... but hey, at least you don't have two mutually incompatible rules anymore!-orthonormal
Or, to put it the other way around, the social norm is to escalate in small stages with reciprocity (like the exchange between spies), maintaining plausible deniability so that either party can back out while saving face.I think this once again forces the question: How does this, which you recommend, differ from the thing Scott was actually analogizing to an exchange between spies, which is apparently super creepy?Edited at 2012-09-14 03:03 am (UTC)

I've seen this topic batted back and forth over the past couple of weeks, and this seems like a reasonable enough place to pitch in about it.I'm something of a nerd-done-good success story as far as the opposite sex is concerned. Ten years ago I was 320lbs of mobile butter who would talk to you at length about elves, vampires and starships. At this very moment in time there are four women concurrently expressing an interest in me, and there's a reasonable chance I'm going to turn them all down. Butter-vampire-starship-me is screaming at present-me across the intervening decade. If he was here right now, I wonder what I would tell him. The more I think about it, the more I realise it's the same as what I want to tell every exponent of "Nice Guy Syndrome".We were told, explicitly, that you had to be nice to women and respect them. We were also told not to try and coerce them into things they didn't want to do. We weren't really told anything else. If you're a literal-minded kid, your conceptual model of how romance works goes as follows:- Find a girl you like- Be nice to her- Express no sexual interest in her whatsoever- Wait for her to realise how nice you are- Mutually confess your undying love- Happy ever afterI even remember, as a young teen, thinking "how the hell is this actually supposed to work?" Media portrayals of relationships do nothing to dispel this idea, and while this model might get more nuanced as you get older, the only thing that will really correct it is experience. Experience is hard to come by when you spend six months at a time platonically gurning at the object of your affections, wondering why it hasn't worked yet.With the best of intentions, we're just doing what we've been instructed to do. When we realise it doesn't work, there are two obvious and repugnant explanations: there's something wrong with us, or there's something wrong with ALL WOMEN. The two aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, but it's easy to see how the former leads people into being angry Forever Alone perma-virgins, while the latter leads people into being angry misogynists. Failing at something by just doing what you were told is bad enough. Having someone turn round and accuse you of being some sort of horrible predator because you're just doing as you were told? That feels like the pinnacle of unfairness.Of course, the actual explanation is that the model is simply incorrect, and romantic interest is signalled and solicited through a selection of oblique processes commonly called "flirting". I imagine a lot of guys who weren't told to be nice or respectful to women probably stumbled across flirting quite by accident from a young age. To butter-vampire-starship-me, it was like witchcraft.As I currently understand it, flirting basically comes down to transgressing politeness norms in a non-threatening way. If it's reciprocated, you push the envelope a little further. Repeat until bored or naked. Unfortunately "non-threatening" is somewhat subjective. If you're John Merrick the Elephant Man, chances are that walking up to someone on a crowded street in the middle of the day and saying hello will come across as a bit threatening. Life is horribly unfair a lot of the time.I say this as a &gt;6' tall not-obviously-unattractive fairly eloquent guy with a well-paying job in one of the most populous cities in the world, but it doesn't really strike me as being that hard to negotiate mutual attraction. It's unfortunate that the only group currently motivated to correcting men's misguided beliefs about romance is the PUA community, many of whom are insufferable shitbricks. Men deserve a better class of instructor, and women deserve to benefit from that.
I agree with you entirely, I just think that if romance is really "transgressing politeness norms in a non-threatening way" and if the criteria for "threatening" differs from person to person and is impossible to pin down, then people either need to change how they do romance, or else stop getting upset when people transgress politeness norms just slightly too much and they find it threatening.I agree with you about the need for dating advice that's less sleazy than PUA, except that I think it probably already exists but gets lumped into the category of "PUA" merely because it is dating advice.
I think you (and your former friend) are missing something seriously important about Nice Guys.There are two kinds of Nice Guys. There are guys like you (and me, back in early college) who do what you did and then feel all guilty/sad about it but understand the woman's point of view, do their best continue being friends, and try not to bring it up ever again. It doesn't always work, because things can get awkward, but it's clear you didn't intend any ill will toward her after she rejected you.Then there are the other Nice Guys. These guys, when rejected, feel outraged. They get bitter that their love interest isn't interested in them, that she's only interested in "Bad Boys." So they retaliate. They cut off the friendship, spread horrible rumors about her, call her a slut, etc. (Since, apparently, being there for a friend is Work that deserves a Reward.) Yes, this is a real thing, see the comments here for some examples. You'll see both horror stories from women AND the bad kind of Nice Guy chiming into the comments and saying the exact awful things the article accuses them of believing. It also happened to my wife in college. She lost a good friend who became her bitter enemy, picking on her in class, keeping her from being invited to parties, spreading awful false rumors about her, all because she said "no."If they're called on any of this, they give a spiel about how they were always there when she wanted to cry on his shoulders about other guys, the least she could do is put out. A lot of slut-shaming fantasy goes on, stuff like, "Well I'm done with this, when she does finally come around, I'll just tell her her vagina's ruined! Ha!"I'm sorry your former friend reacted that way--she should have differentiated between kinds of Nice Guys. But the demonization of Nice Guys is not entirely unreasonable. A good portion of them actually are sexist creeps. This just exacerbates the problem you're describing, of course, and makes fixing it harder.
I see what you're saying and it makes sense but I want to mention two very small points.First, I don't think worrying that a love interest is only into "bad boys" is on a par with all those other bad things you say define the "bad sort of nice guys". I may be very biased, but many people I've seen do seem to make pretty self-destructive choices (I particularly remember one of my violent sorta psychopathic patients at the hospital boasting that he could get any girl he wanted, then backing it up by seducing some of the other patients). Although of course people have to make their own choices and even their own mistakes, I can definitely see how people could be legitimately upset here.Second, I have on occasion avoided women who have rejected me just because it's really really awkward to be around them afterwards and I feel like they're constantly judging me. It doesn't mean I feel like "Well, if you rejected me our friendship is over", and usually I can eventually continue being friends with them a while later (I realize this sort of spoils my outrage when my friend did the same to me, although she was a close friend and I feel like she could have done something better than stop all communication). But I would be very hesitant to accuse men of being mean or spiteful just because they stop hanging out with a woman who rejects them.Obviously if they're insulting her or whatever that's a different story.
Your friend who expected you to magically intuit it was okay to touch her breasts? She was in the wrong. It not only wasn't a reasonable expectation on its own merits, but it was her turn to escalate after you took the risk of initiating cuddles.
Gaah! No! I didn't mean to imply she was in the wrong and she's one of the nicest people I know and I'm actually amazed she was awesome enough to correct me on this.
Looks like I have a bit to say in response to this one, since it strikes very close indeed. I've been in a position somewhat similar to that of your former close friend, though it wasn't quite as bad as that and there was plenty of what I saw as creepiness involved.One problem is that once a guy has expressed romantic interest, even if I trust him and don't think he's a total creep for it, it's really difficult to just be friends again, as if it didn't happen. This seems very irrational once I type it out, but it's nevertheless true. Maybe it's just me?guys have one ladder, People I LikeThis is a big surprise. I always thought that guys were the ones with two ladders.I think a lot of the problem is not that the rules are stupid, but that people on both sides are really bad at following the rules. Girls who send signals so subtle that the other side can't understand them, or guys who don't take an obvious 'no' signal, or who see the 'no' signal and don't seem to care.This can be a problem with the Soviet Spy Strategy. Consider:Spy: Excuse me, do you know any good borscht restaurants around here?Me: Ah, borscht. I love borscht!Spy: I hear Russian borscht is the best. Me: Well, yes, I suppose so...Spy: Really? Have you ever been to [street the KGB headquarters is on?]Me: No, I have not. Here's the address of a good borscht restaurant, why don't you go and try it?Spy: Certainly! Would you care to accompany me? Me: Thank you, but I have to go to work.Spy: I will come and pick you up after work. We can have borscht and discuss America's nuclear bomb program.Me: What? No, thank you, I'm not interested in nuclear bombs.Spy: Perhaps I can make borscht for you.Me: *starts walking really fast*[cut to next morning, when I open my door to see Spy holding two bowls of borscht]Spy: See, I have brought you some borscht! Now do you want to discuss America's secret stockpiles of plutonium?Me: You know what? Thanks to you, I never want to see borscht again. For the rest of the year I will avoid my favorite borscht restaurant for fear of being annoyed by you. Next time I am asked if I like borscht, I am going to lie out of fear. You have now ruined borscht for me forever.Spy: But you said you liked borscht! All I wanted to know was whether you were a Soviet spy, like me! Me: *calls police*OK, got a little carried away there. But it happens.Edited at 2012-09-14 04:24 am (UTC)

I want to chime in here and say that a lot of creepy behavior isn't "sinister" in the sense that it has the secret motive of "I want to do this to eventually make babies" but happens because it's strongly desired. To pull a very recent example from my life: sitting next to a cute female friend of mine in a car on a bumpy road trip. She's married, I like her husband. I have literally zero intention to do anything "creepy" or romantic at her. But even so, I viscerally enjoy every single time a bump causes her leg to touch mine. I have a strong desire to hold her hand when it's near mine, even though I know perfectly that this is unwanted, would have bad consequences, and is "creepy". When she nods off and ends up leaning against me, I love it. I'm not intentionally trying to feel any of this. It's just what I feel whenever I'm next to a girl I like, this constant desire to touch and be touched. Im well aware both that my desire for this sort of thing is higher than others and that my threshold of needing to know someone before doing things is lower, which gives me I hope a reasonable level of caution. I know no everyone is willing to cuddle within hours of meeting. But I haven't always been this conscious, and wanting something very much can easily distort your view of how others feel about it. I'm horrified of frightening someone by ramping up physicality too fast, so I am certain I am more cautious than I need be. It's all too easy to imagine people with less awareness who do something they want very badly and simply dont understand why instead of just being rejected they become shunned. I really wish it were acceptable for me/others to wear things that signify "kiss me, it's ok! I like tongue!"

This was not intentionally anonymous but I'm going to leave it that way because I'm pretty sure it's creepy to admit to having the thoughts and feelings that I do.
Sometimes, it goes like this:* guy and girl make friends. yay* guy admits to an attraction for the girl. * she doesn't like him "that way", but 'I don't want to lose your friendship, let's stay friends'.* he agrees* some time later, maybe after a glass of wine or two, he tries to go to kiss her* or he keeps asking her out about once a week* or every time she naturally goes to hug him, he seems to be trying to use the hug as a way to push on the relationship* she is shocked and horrified because she thought they'd agreed to stay friends* she can't comfortably be alone with him, has to modify her behaviour around him, etc* she ends up pushing him away repeatedly over a period of time, until she decides it's easiest to cut her losses and give up on the friendship.When I say 'sometimes', I'm not sure I've ever had a guy admit attraction to me, and successfully maintain a friendship afterwards. After several awkward failures, I'd be inclined to give up pretty fast these days. I know other women who have had the same trouble.
the thing being - just as ferrett's coffee shop thing or the indian beggars or whatever is supposed to be an analogy for guys she doesn't know - how does she know that you're the one genuinely good guy? It turns out to be just the same with guys she does know: how does she know that you're the one guy who won't suddenly turn creepy on her. Only, the discovery that you are (statistically, not necessary actually...) creepy after all is way more painful when she thought you were friends than when she didn't know you from adam.

An obvious solution is to agree on a set of standards to use when asking someone out.How about internet dating? I know two couples who met using okcupid and have been together for years. If there's a stigma around it now I expect it will be gone soon.Okcupid also avoids some of the problems with "learn by doing it badly" as discussed in part 3. If you accidentally do something creepy in front of a stranger, it's easier to think about that as "oops" rather than "oh god I am a terrible person forever". Also they can't wreck your reputation....I guess I should disclaim that I don't have an okcupid account myself. I've gone to the profile creation thing a few times, but I always get five minutes in and get an extremely strong desire to be doing something -- anything -- else. But that is a problem with me, not with internet dating.
http://lesswrong.com/lw/rn/no_universally_compelling_arguments/ , right?In this particular case, the rules you get from reading angry Social Justice Warrior blogs (clues: mentions "privilege", "de-railing" etc; check the bingo card) are probably only suitable for seducing SJWs. If SJWs are the dominant culture where you are, sure, deduce their rules. If they're not, work out what the actual culture is. In the UK it's pretty weird to ask out total strangers on the street, for example, whereas I've heard in other countries people do that sort of thing. The US has a culture where you go on "dates" with multiple people (You Americans are so quaint with your whole "dating" thing. It always makes me picture you driving your T-birds to the hop or jitterbugging at the diner, you crazy cats), we don't. And so on. Learning how that works is more likely to be useful than worrying about the opinions of whoever bellows loudest on Dreamwidth.And okay, this is all super creepy, and I know that now, and I'm sorry for doing it, and I won't do it again.No, AFAICT it's more or less what people do outside the circles where it's normal for everything to be very explicit. The SJWs might like it if these circles were wider, but in fact they're not.
Funny, London's the only place I've been in that I was asked out on the street. Most notably, guy walked up to me and said perkily "hey, would you like to get a drink?", I said "sorry, I'm heading home to look after my sick husband" (true at the time), and he said "no worries, have a good day!". It's one of the stories I use to depict behaviour that I respect. I had a few other experiences, some negative. Anyway, this is all a bit of a digression... As much as the British have a reputation for being emotionally reticent, I found the culture very socially aggressive (well, in London at least). When I got back to NZ I found myself practically terrorising shop assistants. It really does highlight your point about needing to read the culture.
Me: I am a Soviet spy. Are you one too?Other Spy: Yes.ROFL! That dialogue is awesome.I don't think it's quite right for actual spies, since during the cold war you probably want to find something that an actual spy would recognise as russian-spy stuff, but a random American wouldn't -- I expect during the McCarthy period you WOULD be arrested for asking for borscht restaurants :) But that's irrelevant to the analogy, which I agree is good.Except, I think the borscht-dance[1] is basically flirting, which is how it's supposed to work. The problem is, people have different awareness/expectation for what constitutes "showing interest", so it's not as simple as "be slightly less ambiguous and see if the other party reciprocates, and if so, proceed, and if not, abort". Ideally, if you move things up a notch (going from talking to extended eye contact, going from a back rub to asking if they want a full body rub, etc), they will give an unambiguous enthusiastic "yes" and escalate in turn, or unambiguously show no interest, and you'll know they're not interested and to stop escalating.But for various reasons, both natural variation and social conditioning, it can be ambiguous. Is someone not showing interest because they're not very socially aware? Because they're not interested? Because they're interested, but have been conditioned to let the other party make all the moves, and think "not fighting you off" is all the consent they're "allowed to" express?And there is no perfect algorithm. People like to think there is, and give pretty good ones. But the best you can do is work out what's most likely, and to ask if you're not sure, but there's overlap from both ends -- some people won't show interest unless you ask them directly, which would be creepily pressuring for other people, and you can do your best to tell which are which, but there will always be times when people missed an opportunity or creeped out someone uninterested, and all you can do is minimise it as much as possible.[1] Which is totally my new euphemism for flirting :)
How would you feel if a woman you're not attracted to showed interest in you? Or if that has happened, how would you feel? Edited at 2012-09-14 04:57 pm (UTC)
It happened once or twice and I just nodded and said thank you and then desperately tried to get out of the situation....actually, that was in late middle school/early high school, where even when a woman I *was* attracted to showed interest in me I nodded and said thank you and then desperately tried to get out of the situation. I...wasn't very good at this back then.
I'm not sure the supposed difference in having separate ladders is a gender things specifically, I suspect it's that people societally expected to do the chasing are more likely to view everyone they like as a potential romantic partner, but people who are expected to be chased are more likely to pre-emptively filter people into "I like them but don't fancy them" bucket.That is, I expect male rock stars and men who are genuinely happily committed and not interested in sex with more different people to see people as "appropriate for a romantic interest" and "don't think of you like that" the same as stereotyped women would.
Or to put it another way, even if it is true that many men filter most attractive people of their desired sex and approximately the same age into the "potential romantic interest" bucket, they probably have people they genuinely don't put in that bucket, it's just not as obvious because as long as they only consider hitting on people they're potentially attracted to, it never comes up.
I don't think your proposed solution will help matters for men, because I find the 'internalization of low status' hypothesis for why most men find it difficult to talk to women at first much, MUCH more plausible for the general population of men than your proposed 'fear of backlash' hypothesis. To illustrate why I think this, I am going to psychologize both you and myself, for which I deeply apologize and if you delete this comment I will understand.Let us start with you. I only know what you've made public, but from what I know you've been on a solid status growth period for the last four years or so. First there was Livejournal, which got you something of a clique following. Then there was Less Wrong, where post after post of yours got upvoted and praised and critiqued-in-a-good-way and blah blah, and this kept happening, and then you got to meet awesome people like Michael Vassar just because people liked your writing, and then you won two contests solely on your merit, and now you've gone and gotten a medical degree.Excuse me for going out on a limb, but this sort of tremendous slew of impressive accomplishments seems like the sort of thing that would convince your subconscious that you're not such a low status monkey anymore. Meanwhile, the potential backlash hasn't changed!---As far back as I remember I had crushes. I had two in freaking preschool. I have never had the ability to initiate a conversation with a woman in my life. But introspecting, I can't find any trace of fear in why this is the case. I don't make rationalizations, I don't feel terribly nervous around women, I don't start thinking "OH GOD WHAT IF SHE GETS CREEPED OUT AND I AM HUMILIATED FOREVER". I just can't talk to girls. So, what IS going on? The only plausible explanation I can think of* is that I have fully internalized a perception of Absolute Minimum Status. I'm poor, basically friendless, and have no skills, and could not be more aware of this.*(And some other reasons that I think would be insufficient on their own, which are private.)
That's a good point (and of course very flattering). But it doesn't have to contradict mine.If getting rejected is unpleasant because it's a status threat, then people who feel like they have high enough status already will be able to shrug it off, but someone who feels Absolute Minimum Status won't.There was a really interesting experiment I read last night where they took a bunch of Republicans, showed them information about how terrible an idea the Iraq War was, then tried to see if they would admit it was a terrible idea. Most of them wouldn't. Then they made them do a "self-affirmation exercise" - ie write a bit about how great a person they were and what their good qualities were, pretty much an intervention to raise status. Then they did the same thing with the Iraq War. This time they were much more willing to change their minds.The conclusion was that admitting they were wrong about Iraq would be a status hit. If they felt low status, they would prefer not to take that hit. If they felt high status, they could graciously admit they were wrong and still feel okay about themselves.Maybe rejections work the same way. And the fear of having it become a Big Deal is the fear of losing lots and lots of status with lots and lots of people (I don't know if this is true. I need to think more about it. I do know that I would be much more unhappy to be a second Elevatorgate than I would to just be rejected with a nice "Oh, I'm really flattered, but let's just be friends") and I'm thinking kind of behaviorist-ically about what is reinforcing or punishing my actions.I would say nice things about you and give you advice, but if you're at all like me the nice things would be painful to read and the advice would be super-annoying other-optimizing. But if it helps I think you're pretty okay.Edited at 2012-09-14 07:59 pm (UTC)

I have no idea whether this works, but have you tried plainly asking girls by what rules they operate? Not in an "Suppose I were to ask you out,..." kind of way, just... striking up this very topic? The main reason that might work is that it doesn't sound like anything that is commonly tried. I think that these broken rules mainly exist because if girls offer up a formula by which to ask them, there will always be guys who think that this is all they have to do to get them, and then the situation with the Indian beggar from the first meditation happens.The other reason this might work is that this way not only do you get a hunch of how she wants to be asked, she can get a glimpse of how you might react to a yes or a no, too.</div></div><hr><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" /></head>Page URL: http://squid314.livejournal.com/328267.htmlTitle: Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz - The Third Meditation on Privilege</br>Author: Unknown</br><div><div>
 [trigger warnings: sex and spiders]<p>In the First and Second Meditation on Privilege, I discussed "privilege" with an extended metaphor to Indian beggars. At the end of the last dialogue, myself and the Indian fortune-teller Ganaj had kind of agreed we needed to set some standards to prevent street merchants from become a nuisance while also allowing mutually beneficial transactions. Today I want to talk about one little-appreciated concern that any such standards will have to take into account.</p>
<p>It is really really really hard for guys to ask girls out.</p>
<p>Okay, I agree there are some guys who have no problem with it. I hate them. For the rest of us, and especially for geek guys, it's right up there as one of the most terrifying things we will ever have to do.</p>
<p>I can't justify this. Inspirational articles in magazines and so on always say things like "What's the worst that can happen? She says no?" On a rational level, this makes sense. On a rational level, it also makes sense not to be afraid of tarantulas crawling all over your face. "What's the worst that can happen? They're kinda itchy and you have to spend a few seconds brushing them off?"</p>
<p>And yet arachnophobia exists, and the same is true of the fear of asking women out. I don't know if some women have this same fear about men, although most of the women I've talked to say they don't. If you don't, all I can ask is that you take it on faith that this fear exists as a deep driving existential terror.</p>
<p>Actually, wait. Don't take it on faith. You know how much the average college student obsesses over sex? And you know how 70% of college science majors (our stand-in for geeks here) are virgins? How exactly do you think that happens? You think they ask people out all the time and by an amazing coincidence every single person in the world rejects them? Or do you think that the fear of asking other people out is so strong that in 70% of people it outcompetes college-student-horniness, generally believed to be the strongest force in the universe?</p>
<p>Actually, wait. People never listen to probabilistic arguments anyway. Time for a personal anecdote. The first time I ever asked a girl out (online, mind you) was age 22, despite having (counts) no fewer than seven massive life-consuming burning-fire-of-a-hundred-suns crushes before that age.</p>
<p>The first time I asked a girl out in person was three years later, when I was 25 and in medical school. It was around the same time I first intubated a desperately ill patient in the emergency room. Guess which one was more stressful?</p>
<p>I am sort of over that now. I grew up, became more confident, got buoyed by a few times I asked people out and they said yes. I will never get over it completely, but like the arachnophobe who gingerly leaves the safety of his house into the potentially spider-infested outside world, I thought I was doing pretty okay.</p>
<p>Then I started reading blogs that discussed gender.</p>
<p>And in one sense, I am grateful. You remember that old, loaded question: "If you ask her out, what's the worst thing that can happen?"</p>
<p>Well, now I can respond quickly and confidently: "She might be a blogger who rejects me and then writes online how she thought I was a creep. The story gets picked up by feminist bloggers, and then by anti-feminist bloggers who use it as an example of what is wrong with the feminists, until eventually three or four large subcultures are debating it simultaneously. It snowballs until it gets its own its own Wikipedia entry and then a competing Conservapedia entry explaining exactly what was wrong with the Wikipedia entry and which incidentally is longer than Conservapedia's article on God meaning that my failed attempt to ask this one woman out is literally a bigger deal than the all-powerful creator of the Universe. It is welcomed into the realm of Official Scandals by being granted its own -gate suffix, and a Google search for it turns up 13900 results, including the biography of the girl I asked, the twitter hashtag relating to my rejection, and the one year retrospective. Hundreds of rape threats ensue. Richard Dawkins takes a break from being one of the world's leading public intellectuals to get involved. And if Conservapedia is to be believed (sic), it apparently leads directly to the decline of atheism and the explosive growth of global Christianity."</p>
<p>It would be like finding that hypothetical arachnophobe as he takes those first few cautious steps out of his house, covering yourself in tarantulas, and running by waving your arms shouting "SPIDERS!!! SPIDERS EVERYWHERE!!!"</p>
<p>No, imagine a young child who is afraid of ghosts. Every day for several years, her parents try to convince her that her fear is irrational, that there's no such thing. Finally, she starts to believe it herself. And then...you remember when you saw that scene from Ghostbusters where the hundred-foot-high Gozer starts rampaging around the streets of New York? It would be like that. Not like seeing the movie. Like actually having a hundred-foot tall ghost destroy your city.</p>
<p>And now you're going to say - but the problem wasn't that he asked her out. The problem was that he did it in an elevator.</p>
<p>Okay. I've already made myself look pretty ridiculous in this post, so let me go the whole way.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I the third or fourth time I read about that scandal that I realized it had anything to do with the elevator. I think I had to read some blog's interpretation where they actually came out and said "...and because they were in an elevator and trapped with one another, that made it really uncomfortable." Before that, I just figured it was called "Elevatorgate" for the same reason that the Clinton scandal was called "Whitewatergate" - because the proper procedure for scandal name formation involves appending -gate to the end of the location where the scandal took place. </p>
<p>The fact is, I'm oblivious. There are probably hundreds of perfectly reasonable rules about asking women out, and I could be missing any of them. "What's the problem? I just asked her out while it was raining." "You asked her out while it was raining? You monster!" And I'm sure that after it was explained to me why rain would seem threatening I would understand it, but the whole point of privilege (now officially renamed "blind spots", sorry everyone else but you just have to catch up) is that it's something you don't understand and probably would never think about unless someone tells you. Even if I study appropriate asking-out procedure from now until doomsday, there's always the chance I missed the one relevant feature ("You asked her out during an election year? You monster!") and the whole point of being phobic is that as long as there's the chance it will activate your phobia you never do it.</p>
<p>I am not blaming that one blogger. It wasn't her fault it became Literally Bigger Than God. I am just relating my experience, which is possibly a more general Male Experience. I am just saying that the culture of super extreme public vilification of unintentional creepiness has consequences. The 70% of men who are already terrified to death of asking women out get even more neurotic. The guy you've had a crush on for the past year considers asking you out, then has a panic attack and decides against it.</p>
<p>This is why I insisted on such a laborious metaphor explaining that creepiness comes not from male power but from male weakness. We are frickin' terrified here. I hesitate to write this because the modern zeitgeist insists that claims of weakness are inevitably associated with claims that the other side is oppressing you and is an evil tyrant and therefore they are bad and you are good and you should get to dictate terms to them. And so any claim of weakness is treated just as harshly as any other power ploy would be.</p>
<p>I'm not claiming weakness in the sense of claiming a moral right over you or demanding you satisfy obligations to me. I'm claiming weakness in the sense of oh god oh god please don't hurt me PLEASE NOT THE SPIDERS.</p>
<p>EDIT: celandine13 immediately hits the heart of the idea I was flailing around trying and failing to express. From her comment:</p> Here's an interesting thing. The standard recommendation for getting over social anxiety, the only thing that I believe really WORKS, is "Do it wrong." Go from being afraid of saying the wrong thing, to getting out there and *saying the wrong thing* (because you're not nearly at the skill level to avoid being awkward), to finally becoming graceful enough to say the right thing. That's what I did in college. There was a lot of screwing up the courage to poke people on Facebook. My first attempt at a relationship involved me waiting THREE YEARS for that one guy, asking him out at yearly intervals until he finally figured he wasn't going to do better than me. It was not smooth. But doing the wrong thing was better than not doing it at all. Now I can, you know, introduce myself to strangers and make friends and have a happy relationship.But here's the thing. If you're a guy asking women out, the philosophy of "do it wrong" means "Ask women out, and don't worry if you're being awkward or annoying: just practice having the courage to do it at all." But -- almost by definition -- asking women out in a way they don't like means being a "creep." And I don't like the idea that there's no space for someone who's awkward or annoying but morally innocent.Long ago, my boyfriend used to be socially awkward, and especially had a hard time getting dates. Nobody perceived him as a person with a romantic or sexual side; it doesn't even occur to people that that geeky guy in the corner would even *want* a girlfriend. So (he told me) he started to make a lot of annoying jokes with sexual innuendo. He was obnoxious. But it was a form of "doing it wrong" while he practiced learning to do it right. Putting himself out there, however awkwardly, as somebody who *is* interested in girls. (FWIW, when Pervocracy talks about how *she* used to be "creepy" it sounds like the same phase in development. From cripplingly shy to obnoxiously obsessed with sex to healthy and balanced.)If we don't have a way of talking about people who are unappealing or annoying or obnoxious but *not* akin to sexual predators, then any time somebody does the necessary work of "doing it wrong" we make him out to be a villain. Yeah. It takes time to learn these kinds of things. Some people learn them in middle school and are suave and attractive by high school. Other people take until college. And some people like me don't even start getting better until we're in our mid-twenties and goodness only knows how far I have left to go.</div></div><hr>
